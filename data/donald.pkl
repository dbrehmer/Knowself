p4
aVHillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
p5
aVI made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.

p21
aVWhy is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
p22

p24

p28

p29
aVHappy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6
p30
aVCrooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

p34
aVThe SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
p35

p36
aV"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
p37

p38
aVCrooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
p39

p40
aVJust watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
p41
aVIt was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
p42

p782
aVKasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
p783
aVShows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
p784
aVLyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
p785
aVLyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
p786

p2203
aVI don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!
p2204
aVTed Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
p2205
aVI loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd, unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! https://t.co/YrLGb7wXyh
p2206
aVWe launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: https://t.co/NXWNOcWZgc https://t.co/52E3LU3W77
p2207
aVA great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. #Trump2016 \u000ahttps://t.co/XUWGANbq8k https://t.co/aEMUMqSoWm
p2208
aVLeaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016
p2209
aVJust a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. https://t.co/gBnsNgomom
p2210
aVThank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH &amp; IA radio ad: https://t.co/NqJJVdapnG
p2211
aV"@pbralick: @BenKissel great on @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @JoNosuchinsky too"  Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate!
p2212
aVI am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.
p2213
aVFar more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!
p2214
aVBig announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016 https://t.co/J2wyAfXdlz https://t.co/lErVfowpMX
p2215
aVIran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!
p2216
aVIn Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!
p2217
aVInteresting read from Peggy Noonan. https://t.co/jAxIy8xseM
p2218
aVIs this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about &amp; demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku
p2219
aVWow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, &amp; $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
p2220
aVDeparting NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! https://t.co/m98wooUwsG https://t.co/izBMhEZolh
p2221
aVGreatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form &amp; not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
p2222
aVWhen will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
p2223
aVEverybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
p2224
aVIf Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
p2225
aVTed is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. \u000ahttps://t.co/hxdfy0mjVw
p2226
aVGreat new numbers. Thank you! \u000a#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\u000ahttps://t.co/Z1lQdxQvRL https://t.co/GFYNUWWCYn
p2227
aVTed Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
p2228
aVBased on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
p2229
aVOh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
p2230
aVThe Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
p2231
aVWas there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
p2232
aVTed Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
p2233
aVTed Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
p2234
aVMore radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.
p2235
aV.@FrankLuntz is a total clown. Has zero credibility!  @FoxNews  @megynkelly

p2300
aVIf their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn\u2019t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can\u2019t win.

aVThank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out &amp; VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/RSZF12Kyhn

aVHillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
p2395
aVAl-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner &amp; if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!
p2396
aVHillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.

p2407
aVI hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
p2408
aVHillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
p2409
aVHillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
p2410
aV.@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!
p2411
