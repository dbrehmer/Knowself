p220
aVBeing stuck like this gives me the rare chance to reflect on memories of the many events in my life. Stupid life!

p222
aVIt all starts at 10AM tomorrow!  By 'it" I mean another day of skipping work and going to Moe's.
p223
aVAn amazing 278 hours over 12 straight days. That's how long I've gone without strangling Bart.  #ProudPapa
p224
aVFor a TV show to still be here after 25 years is impressive. For a chicken nugget under the couch it's a miracle. And delicious!
p225
aVI don't know how marathon runners do it. Even the fastest ones have to go 2 hours between meals!
p226
aVMaking it through 552 episodes is something I'm proud of. Especially considering 4 of those episodes were technically "infarctions".
p227
aVI'm preparing for a record-breaking marathon. I'm gonna spend the next week tossing out all 552 of my Dad's Dean Martin albums.

p246
aVWhy does the Ice Cream Truck have to play that one stupid song over and over again as I stand there eating at it for two hours?

p248
aVI'm happy for baseball to start up again. It was terrible not having anything to complain about being boring for three days!
p249

p251
aVBuild a better corndog where the stick is another corndog and the world will beat a path to your door.

p253
aVI\u2019m with Lenny in the hospital. He can barely talk but he did request that you don\u2019t send flowers. Baskets of assorted meats are good.
p254
aVI hated that the holiday is over, so I put a big bottle rocket in Lenny's work locker! He's in guarded condition, upgraded from grave.
p255
aVIf a burger falls thru the BBQ slats, do NOT try to retrieve it with your fingers. Your tongue is thinner &amp; will get the job done nicely.

aVI nodded off for an hour -- thank God I only missed five minutes of game play.  #SB48
p282
aV@OmahaSteaks Thanks, but I think Peyton needs it more than me! #Broncos #SB48
p283
aVThat amazing commercial with Morpheus was so memorable! They sure got their money\u2019s worth! What was it advertising, though?
p284
aVAnd the first half ends!  Time for the traditional and ceremonial "Changing Of Which Butt Cheek I'm Sitting On." #SB48
p285
aVI hear Jimmy Hoffa is buried under the 50 yard line. He must've known somebody pretty important to get that great view.  #SB48
p286

p287
aVAnd it's kickoff! Time to take a little nap.  #SB48
p288
aVLook at those idiots freezing their butts off at #SB48! I'm freezing my butt off in the comfort of my "didn't pay the gas bill" home.
p289
aVTo answer all your questions -- Yes, I did used to own the @Broncos. I sold them after they stupidly got rid of @TimTebow. #SB48

p296
aVIn honor of Dr. King, I will only buy king-sized sodas and candy bars today. And every day.
p297
aVAt Moe's watching the NFC Championship game. I'm rooting for the 49ers -- they were named after my pants size!
p298
aVI don't know if Tom Brady or Peyton Manning has it sweeter. Brady's married to a model, but Peyton can get his hands on lots of pizza.
p299
aVLisa just explained Bart's "SAG Award" joke to me. Putting on my strangling shoes.
p300

p301
aVJust saw that new Jack Ryan movie. Man, Alec Baldwin is looking better than ever!

p308
aVHappy 2014 everyone! May this be the year we finally find peace on earth and an airplane seat that I can fit in.

p310
aVTHE YEAR IN REVIEW:  started out drunk, ended up drunk, can't really remember what happened in the middle.

p315
aVThe idiots in this mall who waited til the last minute are ruining it for geniuses like me who waited til the last hour!

p317
aVToday's a good day to get a great deal on dried out bent Christmas trees with some kind of disease.
p318
aVOn top of all my Christmas shopping, now I have to buy a new mattress. The "Memory Foam" in my old one has PTSD.

aVEgg Nog is the worst thing ever. Bacon and Egg Nog is the best thing ever.
p321
aVHey, @FoxNews lady: in my household, Santa is yellow!
p322
aVIs it weird to have erotic dreams about Cleatus the FOX football robot? Asking for a friend.  A friend named Moe.
p323
aVAt church, I prayed for Thanksgiving to come back. When I got home I found some turkey skin under the trash can liner.  Thank you, God!
p324
aVI'm heading to Moe's for "Blue Saturday" -- the traditional start of the Christmas Depression Drinking Season.
p325
aVLike all patriotic Americans, the Simpsons went to the mall today and punched other patriotic Americans trying to grab an Xbox.
p326
aVI sure hope "Black Friday" refers to how your toes are supposed to look, or else I need to see a doctor.
p327
aVOkay, TV, if you can put Xmas specials on Thanksgiving night then I can watch them drinking Xmas rum and starting Xmas fights.
p328
aVEating turkey makes you tired. And fighting off family members who want some turkey for themselves makes you exhausted.
p329
aVI just set a new Thanksgiving record! This year,  I undid the top button of my pants during "Grace".
p330
aVYou know those "Brown N Serve" dinner rolls in a plastic bag?  You can eat 'em quicker if you don't brown and leave them in the bag.
p331
aVWoo Hoo!  It's officially Thanksgiving!   Must... snort... mashed potatoes.
p332
aVWhy does Thanksgiving have to be so late this year?! I'm dreaming of cranberry sauce can ridges!
p333
aVToday I killed 2 birds with one stone: I raked the leaves into a big pile covering the other big pile of Halloween decorations.
p334
aVI'm getting a jump on Black Friday with Red Saturday. I'm going to eat spaghetti and drink wine all day.
p335
aVSo now I'm supposed to grow a mustache for "Mo-Vember"?! Isn't my manly muzzle fuzz enough for you people?!
p336
aVI'm in that golden time when I can eat Halloween candy from the sack and pre-eat Thanksgiving stuffing from the can.

p343
aVIf anyone asks, I'm going as "Drunk Dad" tonight. #halloween
p344
aVI made a #WorldSeries bet with the Mayors of both Boston AND St. Louis. I'm gonna win and/or lose beer and/or beans!

p351
aVThis so-called Halloween "super store" stinks! I can't find a man's size 4X sexy nurse costume anywhere!
p352
aVThe supermarket only had 20 bags of candy corn left. THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN MUST END NOW
p353
aVI tried to sit through a news report about #Obamacare, but I suffer from a pre-existing condition: Restless Remote-Thumb Syndrome.

p356
aVMarge and I are off to "Back To School Night" -- to be followed by "Back To Strangling Bart Night."

aVTonight I took the kids to the Drive In Theater. Then when the movie started I abandoned the car and walked to Moe's. #GoodTimes
p361
aVI got so sunburned today that you could fry an egg on my head and when you did and your name was Bart I strangled you.
p362
aVDO NOT hook up a Slip 'N Slide to a keg. Beer isn't "slidey" enough and if your dog drinks it he'll become a mean drunk. #TheMoreYouKnow
p363
aVI could win the big Hot Dog Eating Contest if I wanted, but I refuse to let TV money sully the beautiful art of cramming food in my hole.
p364
aVWhile we're all having fun today, don't forget the brave souls who fought off the great alien invasion of 1996. Keep the "I" in ID4!

p366
aVI gave my Dad a great Father's Day gift -- pretending to listen to his nonsense. #LivingYears

p371
aVTo the haters that said I couldn't cook hot dogs in my radiator while driving, I got 2 franks and a horrible stomach ache to prove you wrong
p372
aVCan't wait for summer and the real fun - speeding through school zones!
p373
aVChoking Bart today, I noticed he got taller. Life. One minute you're choking a boy, and in a blink, you're choking a man
p374
aVMarge wanted to see Gatsby and I wanted to see Ironman.  Compromise: we saw Gatsby but I made explosion noises every 3 minutes.
p375

aVMay The Eleventh Be With You! #BartToldMeThisWasAThing
p378
aVApril comes in like a lamb &amp; goes out like a lion. Same thing cats can do when Prof. Frink gets his animal changing machine working.
p379
aVI celebrate Earth Day every day. It's easy when a judge sentences you to a million hours of roadside trash pick up.
p380
aVI'm writing this from work. At least when I should be at work and on a computer I took from work. So pretty much the same thing.
p381
aVI was rejected for lap band surgery. Apparently they don't come in my size yet.
p382
aVIf Mr. Burns didn't want me to make s'mores at work, he shouldn't have let me bring in marshmallows and a hibachi.
p383
aVI'm starting to think some of these college basketball players are more about basketball than college. Sorry if that offends anyone.
p384
aVI like March Madness. It offers a nice change from Grampa's rest-of-the-year-dementia.
p385
aVIn honor of April Fools' Day, I went to the Nuclear Plant on time this morning and will put in a full day's work. HeeHeeHee!
p386
aVI love April Fool\u2019s Day - I get to pretend Bart being my son is just someone pranking me.
p387
aVMy old college Hamburger University didn't make the tournament. They were only ranked as a sesame seed.
p388
aVOf all the months named after things soldiers do, March is for sure the least violent.
p389
aVAs a tribute to passover, for the next seven days I will celebrate with my version - comb over.
p390
aVThe rumors are true: I've been asked to stop going commando. Cartoon pants hide nothing! #JonHamm
p391

p392
aVToday, all the world is fake Irish!

p397
aVWow, everything on Oscar night is so special. This street I'm driving on is made of some kind of red carpet.

aVI'm driving Maggie to the Oscars tonight. It's a dream come true -- to spend 5 hours in a limo holding area!
p399
aVI picked a super romantic movie to set the mood with Marge tonight -- "Flowers In The Attic"!
p400
aVWhen you're a guy like me, every day is Valentine's Day.  And every day is St. Patrick's Day.
p401
aVI'm spending V-Day today with my first and one true love. Then after I see the new "Die Hard" movie I'm having dinner with Marge!
p402
aVWow, a million people read what I say! I feel like a reporter for the @nytimes, except I'll still have a job in two years.
p403
aVI just heard my pal Ted Nugent is attending the President's speech tonite. He must be Obama's friend too! #SOTU http://t.co/7wGPj9tg
p404
aVWell, football season is over.  But bum fight season at Moe's is only a week away!
p405
aVDear taco commercial: Old folks don't go clubbing when they eat Mexican fast food. They require costly colon surgery. I SHOULD KNOW!

p409
aVOn Groundhog Day each year, I watch that Bill Murray movie where he relives the worst day of his life over and over: "Garfield 2"
p410
aVMy version of Groundhog Day: if I can stand up and see my toes then it means 6 more weeks of late night pancake binges.
p411
aVI'm off to Moe's to spend a thrilling Sunday afternoon and night watching the Pro Bowl! (And if you tell Marge it's lame I'll kill you.)
p412
aVObama gets a huge party just for hanging onto his job? Where's MY "Didn't Royally Screw It Up" parade?
p413
aVIn honor of Dr. King, I will spend all day today having a dream. At my workstation.
p414
aVThe best touchdown today was when I staggered into Moe's bathroom and still was able to find the toilet seat.
p415
aVI only watch the NFC and AFC championship games for the cheaper commercials.
p416
aVI can't believe these TV guys are ignoring the most important part of the Falcons Offense --  The Atlanta Rhythm Section.
p417
aVWill be at Moe's watching football. 4 teams are gonna get ejected from the playoffs, and 3 drunks are gonna get ejected from the bar.
p418
aVI'm expecting some big upsets during the NFL playoffs.  Me knocking over the nachos and dumping my beer down Lenny's pants for example.
p419
aVWhile the Packers play the 49ers I'll be packing 49 hotdogs down my throat.
p420
aVWell, congratulations to that guy who played the top hat guy in that Tommy Lee Jones movie. #Oscars

p422
aVWhat?! Mike Piazza didn't get an Oscar nomination either? Come on!
p423
aVI get home from Moe's at 8AM, and the Oscar nominations are on TV. Don't they know I'm too hungover to see artists rewarded?
p424
aVI can't believe the Hall Of Fame shunned my former teammate Roger Clemens. It's not HIS fault a hypnotist turned him into a chicken!
p425
aVBiggest Baseball Hall Of Fame snub: football players.
p426
aVUp next, 2013, the start of the teenage years of the 21st century. I hope it gets laid more often than I did.
p427
aVWatching bowl games is a great way to find out what colleges would be good for a son who wants to get shirtless and super-drunk a lot.
p428
aVHappy New Year everyone! Let's all enjoy this brief time of happiness before everything starts getting crappy again.
p429
aVWe're all going to Moe's tonight to watch the ball drop!  That's when Barney gets so drunk that his pants fall off.
p430
aVWhen you\u2019re getting drunk on New Years Eve, remember the nuclear plant workers keeping your lights on. We\u2019re getting drunk remembering you.
p431
aVDid you know that it's already New Year's in Australia? My neighbors do!
p432
aVAs the year ends, we should all take time to reflect on how we can improve ourselves. I'm doing it on line at the liquor store.
p433
aVI'm having a hard time working on my New Year's resolutions.  I just can't think of any after "Continue To Be Awesome".
p434
aVOur Christmas tree just died.  Which is pretty good, considering it's been in the living room since last year.
p435
aVJust now getting our Xmas Cards out. It took a while to cut out Flanders's face and replace it with me, but it was worth it.
p436
aVWe\u2019re spending New Year\u2019s in Oahu - for Christmas I gave Marge the complete DVD collection of Baywatch Hawaii.
p437
aVIn this festive season don\u2019t forget your elderly parents... lock \u2019em in their home so they can\u2019t possibly ruin your holiday.
p438
aVI can't believe Bart is hogging the remote control airplane he got for Xmas. I'm the one who sat on it!
p439
aVOkay, Christmas was great but now it's over. Time to put up the Martin Luther King Day decorations!
p440
aVI'm spending a lovely Christmas night in the ER thanks to the plastic box Lisa's new Malibu Stacey came in.
p441
aVMerry Christmas to all my followers! I wish I could visit each and every one of you today.  That'd be 958,000 cookies for me!
p442
aVIt happens every year -- something breaks on Christmas morning. Today it was my promise not to drink until noon.
p443
aVThe kids wouldn't go to bed, so I got the iPod and put "Dominick The Italian Xmas Donkey" on repeat mode. That cleared 'em out!
p444
aVToday we're having a huge Xmas party at the Nuclear Plant.  Mr. Burns and the rest of the workers don't know that yet.
p445
aVGave a close listen to "The Little Drummer Boy". Man, that kid's full of himself!  "The ox and lamb kept time" -- right!
p446
aVI'm giving Grampa a card that says "you get to keep living in the home -- Merry Christmas".  Do you think it's too sweet?
p447
aVOkay, I just cleaned out the last toy store in town. Now to get all the presents not for me.
p448
aV.@PMHarper I see great minds think alike. And I, too, like my bacon super thick and bun-sized!
p449
aVOh man I have so Christmas shopping to do. Thanks a lot, Mayans!
p450
aVI'm enlisting in the War On Christmas! Maybe that'll get me out of having to buy Lenny a Secret Santa gift.
p451
aVIs the song lyric "Up on the rooftop reindeer pause" or "reindeer paws?" A kick to the groin by Moe is riding on it.
p452
aVKrusty wrote that last tweet for me! Actually, I heard him babble it while he slept one off on my lawn this morning.
p453
aVXmas shopping is so crazy. Today, I couldn't even get a parking space at the SkyMall!
p454
aVI'm seeing all this stuff on here today about 12-12-12. Woohoo! My daily donut order is finally trending!
p455
aVI\u2019m a huge #Rams fan! Does \u201cFather Murphy\u201d still play defensive tackle? #bills
p456
aVWow, how does Andy Reid keep himself in such tip-top shape? #eagles #buccaneers
p457
aV.@TonyGonzalez88  is still going strong at age 36, and I\u2019m still going strong at beer 36. #falcons #panthers
p458
aVI would enjoy this game more if they replaced Tony Romo with Tony Roma. #cowboys #bengals
p459
aVI sure hope @BUrlacher54 gets better. Us angry bald men need to stick together. #bears #vikings
p460
aVWatching NFL football is a great way to bond with my son Bart. Anyone out there want to do it?
p461
aVYou guys are so lucky. You always have a good reason to not go to church.
p462
aVAnd so the orgy of eating and drinking that is Thanksgiving ends, and the orgy of boozing and gobbling that is Christmas begins.
p463
aVHoliday snow is falling, laying a festive winter blanket over the fifteen turkey carcasses I left by our garbage. I eat a lot of Turkey.
p464
aVWhat are these "leftovers" you're all talking about? If you can't eat a whole turkey at one sitting you're not American.
p465
aVI'm already half done with my Christmas shopping! I found the gifts I forgot I stuffed under the bed last year.
p466
aVStuck in the car and the kids won\u2019t stop complaining. Post-Thanksgiving traffic is terrible, and my post-Thanksgiving farts are worse.
p467
aVDo I buy Carl a gift for Black Friday? I did when "Men in Black 3" came out. Being racially sensitive is expensive!
p468
aVBlack Friday sale at the mall - the pay toilets are 20% less. Woo-hoo! Finally something I need and can afford!
p469
aVI'm waiting in line for 3 hours to buy Bart a toy he'll break in 3 minutes. Then comes my gift, the strangling!
p470
aVSome say Tryptophan in the turkey is what makes us get sleepy after Thanksgiving dinner. But I know it's the Beer Gravy.
p471
aVMarge tried to slip some fake cranberry sauce past me. It wasn't solid and didn't have tin can-line one!
p472
aVI'm getting a head start on the Holiday this year. I'm eating Thanksgiving dinner with my pants pre-unbuttoned.
p473
aVOh man, the supermarket is all out of turkeys. Thanks for the pardon, Obama!
p474
aVI can't wait for Turkey Day!  That's when I get out my Starsky &amp; Hutch DVDs and have an all-day Huggy Bear episode marathon.
p475
aVI can't believe its November already!   Especially because when I passed out at Moe's and hit my head on the jukebox it was Labor Day.
p476
aVHollywood totally ripped me off!  It was MY idea to make a movie about me called "The Life Of Pie"!  Plus they can't spell.
p477
aVI'm drunk and going to sleep now, so congratulations to Mittrack Obamaney on being re-elected to his first term!
p478
aVTonight I'm playing a Cable News drinking game.  I'm drinking myself blind instead of watching Cable News. And I'm winning!
p479
aVI waited for 4 hours to vote.  Then I realized it was a Lotto tickets line at Kwik-E-Mart.  So I voted for my kids' birthdays.
p480
aVIt's a good thing nobody knows what state I live in -- I haven't seen an election ad all year!
p481
aVSo it's Election Eve -- which means the kids are putting out cookies and milk for Uncle Sam tonight!\u000a\u000aPS: Uncle Sam is me.
p482
aVSpring forward, fall back, new Me!
p483
aVMy boss told me to tweet this video or he'll fire me... for the 523rd time. http://t.co/QhXNcG3f #MeatRomney #BroccoliObama
p484
aVI think it's only fair that I take a 10% "Keeping My Kids Safe" candy fee tonight, don't you?  That flashlight is heavy!
p485
aVHey, kids in Springfield: my house is NOT, repeat NOT, the place with the big-sized candy bars. I give out loose popcorn kernels.
p486
aVI'm going Trick-or-Treating tonight!  My costume: wear an overcoat and go as 2 kids on each other's shoulders.
p487
aVMy #WorldSeries predictions: WINNER: @SFGiants in 7.  MVP: beer.
p488
aVCongrats to the @SFGiants and @tigers! May the steroidiest team win. #WorldSeries
p489
aVWow, did you see the tackle Obama just put on Romney! Oh, wait, Moe has the football game on. Oh wait, no he doesn't.
p490
aVGonna go gambling at an Indian casino, by which I mean buying food products from Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart.
p491
aVPeople, global warming is serious. Forget melting polar icecaps -- if I sweat any more the salty Homer seas will drown us all.
p492
aVMarge says I spend too much time sitting, but when I die, my leathery ass skin will be donated to make orphan shoes.
p493
aVI'm only watching this thing because the moderator's name is "Candy." Hear that, Networks? Americans demand MORE FOOD-PEOPLE!
p494
aVBased on the Town Hall meetings I attend, Romney should be ready for at least one rhyming question from Disco Stu tonite.
p495
aVWe need voter ID laws! It\u2019s the only way to stop my vote from being stolen by some other fat, bald man with no idea what he\u2019s voting about.
p496
aVMy $10,000 challenge to any personal hygiene company: bring on your mightiest deodorant. My underarms will defeat it.
p497
aVAccording to Bart, the new school uniform is a T-shirt reading \u201cFART POWER.\u201d I\u2019m outraged that I never got a school uniform that cool.
p498
aVEvery time a reporter says he's going to interview a politician in the "spin room", I think he's talking about Moe's.
p499
aVI'm not watching the debate. If I wanna see an old nut yell at a young jerk about health care I can just visit Grampa at the Home.
p500
aVI think my doctor will be proud. He wanted me to do 20 knee bends, but I went to Moe\u2019s and did 200 elbow bends.
p501
aVFlanders always complains about sex on TV, but the show that I find the most deeply disturbing is about animals eating a dead hippo.
p502
aVTrees are like traffic lights: they change color from green to yellow to red, and I drive right through \u2019em.
p503
aVWhen Lisa brings her report card home, smiles and applause. When Bart brings his home, complimenting him on his teacher\u2019s penmanship.
p504
aVI got my Halloween decorations up already! Mostly because the Santa I've had on my roof since Xmas now looks like a corpse.
p505
aVThe Mayans say the world is going to end in December. It better or I'm gonna have a whole lot of late car payments to make.
p506
aVWhat do you mean FRANKENWEENIE isn't about a hotdog made up of other hot dogs?!
p507
aVFall transition: Bart\u2019s summer camp closes, then reopens as extra bunking to relieve overcrowding at Springfield Medium Security prison.
p508
aVWhat, now Halloween is a whole month? That is disrespectful to the brave men and women who gave their ears so we could have Rocktober.
p509
aVAngry reader complains: the book \u201cOperation Mincemeat\u201d is a taut, suspenseful WWII thriller, and not at all a ground beef how-to.
p510
aVHere's a question I wish Jim Lehrer had asked tonight: Where did I put the keys to Marge's car? A real leader would know that!
p511
aVMy advice for the President tonight: Ignore any stupid questions and just say "I'm the guy who killed Obama!"
p512
aVMy advice for Romney tonight: Fake a nose bleed, run out and drive away. That always works for me on Teacher Conference Night.
p513
aVEvery network is showing the debate tonight? But I was looking forward to 3 hours of fake reality and lame comedy!
p514
aVThe crisp Fall air reminds me of New England, named after Old England, where \u201ccrisps\u201d mean potato chips, which reminds me: eat more chips.
p515
aVSummer becomes Fall. Return Flanders\u2019 lawnmower. Borrow Flanders\u2019 leaf blower.
p516
aVNow the kids are back in school, gotta practice my Russian phone accent. \u201cHello, Sergei the Plumber, not the parent of Bart Simpson.\u201d
p517
aVFall is coming. Time to deflate the kiddie pool, and inflate my all-day-Sunday football watching neck pillow.
p518
aVThere's so many great TV shows on tonight, I don't know which one to illegally download first! #thesimpsons
p519
aVI hope you're all as excited as I am about my season premiere. My new fall fat folds have come in! #thesimpsons
p520
aVSummer turns to Fall. Time to move the pig-roast fire pit from backyard to bathtub.
p521
aVI don\u2019t know what Los Angeles is complaining about. Every time Bart and Lisa are in the back seat together it\u2019s Carmageddon.
p522
aVSo they tell me this "bacon shortage" isn't real.  If I knew that yesterday that guy at the grocery store might still have thumbs.
p523
aVWatched the Paris Fashion Week shows. Stunning dress designs, and some very appealing elastic-waist pants on a fat guy in the audience.
p524
aVMoe's tavern just got a little classier - a new beer trough!
p525
aVI'm bummed the All-U-Can-Eat buffet place in town closed after only one month! How can that be when I ate there every night?!
p526
aVI'm not enjoying the kids being back in school as much as I should. I hurt my leg dancing with joy.
p527
aVWe're playing a drinking game at Moe's for the #Emmy Awards. The rules are you chug whenever anyone says "Emmy" or "Award".
p528
aVTake a break in all your adulation, Teachers and Soldiers: tonight it's time for TV stars to get a little recognition! #Emmys
p529
aVSo Lenny told me @MittRomney released his tax returns. I have FORCED HIS HAND!  http://t.co/Zy9gJqiS #Obama #Romney
p530
aVThis new iPhone really makes me think about finally trading in my Palm Pilot. It has no good apps.
p531
aVHow come football's on tonight? My stupid TV must think it's Sunday.
p532
aVLook what happened when I tried to exercise my right to vote. The first time I exercised in my life! http://t.co/Zy9gJqiS #Obama #Romney
p533
aVLisa must have changed her name cause people keep asking me if my daughter is Honey Boo Boo.
p534
aVIt's Talk Like A Pirate Day. I'm gonna go with Willie Stargell. He was chubby and swung a sledge hammer in the on-deck circle!
p535
aVHave you guys every tried driving while NOT impaired? It's surprisingly easier.
p536
aVSettle a bet: Lenny says it's "Gangnam Style." I say it's "Condom Style." A workplace sexual harassment lawsuit is riding on it.
p537
aVSeeing how well Peyton Manning came back from his injury makes me think this paper cut on my finger may not be career-ending.
p538
aVThe house is so quiet without the kids or Marge around. Oh wait, I just realized I walked into the wrong house.
p539
aVThe TV season is here! What new show will have what it takes to get me to make the effort of lifting the remote to chest level?
p540
aVMarge is worried Flanders wants to indoctrinate our kids. I say if he wants to pay for all those measles shots, then go for it!
p541
aVSuper-excited for football to start \u2013 the novelty of getting drunk in front of WNBA games has worn off.
p542
aVReady for football season!  It took all 4 weeks of pre-season, but I finally got into \u201csitting\u201d shape.
p543
aVStand Up To Cancer, and believe me I hate both those things. http://t.co/U29NBHbD #istandupfor
p544
aVThat crafty #BarackObama chose "Charlotte" to get the woman vote. The GOP should have their next convention at Whiteman Air Force Base #DNC
p545
aVMan, Bill Clinton is good. His speech almost made me forget all about whatever awful thing he did to that thing that time.
p546
aVDear @PaulRyanVP, not to boast, but MY fastest Marathon time was two seconds. We're talking about the candy bar, right?
p547
aVMitt Romney mystery speaker? My guess: 1) his dog 2) The king of the Cayman Islands.
p548
aVI've got Bieber Fever! Seriously, please call a doctor -- my biebers are inflamed and in constant pain. http://t.co/LY5ziHMO
p549
aVDear @PaulRyanVP, MY veins run with cheese, bratwurst and beer too. Trust me, you're gonna need that Obamacare.
p550
aVI, for one, love the "dog days" of August. Why shouldn't my dog feed and clean up after ME one month out of the year?
p551
aVI\u2019m outraged that basketball is in the #Olympics! The Olympics should only be for sports that nobody watches.
p552
aVThe #Olympics committee needed a steep hill to run the BMX race up and down. I offered my stomach. They accepted.
p553
aVI\u2019m impressed by the #Olympic horses doing dressage. In the morning I can barely dressage myself.
p554
aVAt home we play our own version of table tennis. I serve a meatball to Bart and he hits it back into my mouth. I've never lost once.
p555
aVEvery morning I win the 100 meter dash, from my workstation to the donut cart.
p556
aVIn badminton, they pretend to try while secretly goofing off.  So, me going to work should be an #Olympics sport.
p557
aVWhat\u2019s so hard about throwing a discus?  I throw out a discus in my back every day.
p558
aVI\u2019d be great at #Olympic rowing because when they yell \u201cstroke,\u201d I can have one.
p559
aVUSA wins gold in swimming. I win gold in goldbricking.
p560
aVInspired by the #Olympics, I played some beach volleyball with Barney today, but the cops gave us tickets for not wearing our bikini tops.
p561
aVAnd what do you know? @MittRomney's Vice Presidential pick is... ME! Woo Hoo! I decline.
p562
aV.@MittRomney has decided to announce his pick for Vice President using a Twitter account with more followers than his... MINE!
p563
aV.@RyanLochte, big deal! I could win Gold Medals too if I had talent and the body of a human.
p564
aVI hear they're having a lot of sex in the Olympic Village. I tried to compete but I had to withdraw early.
p565
aVI could be an Olympic athlete -- I have my pee tested regularly. Still 50% alcohol.
p566
aVToday I had an Olympic breakfast: the toast was torched, the eggs were running, and the bacon was swimming in grease. #Classic
p567
aVIn honor of the Olympics, I just had chili and I'm lighting a torch in my pants.
p568
aVDear IOC: I made the Olympic logo out of donuts! Go ahead and sue me -- I'll just eat them.
p569
aVIt\u2019s my busiest time of the work day. When the donuts arrive and I try to eat them all before anyone else can get some.
p570
aVI\u2019m starting to think my plan to rollerblade to the top of Mount Everest might be overly ambitious.
p571
aVDon't worry, it'll never happen. I don't even work when I'm at work.
p572
aVWork time goes so slow and Moe's time goes so fast. If I worked at Moe's, would the universe collapse?
p573
aVMy air conditioner broke, but I'm simulating it with the kids. Lisa's fanning me and Bart's making an obnoxious hum and growing mold.
p574
aVI\u2019ve thought about it a ton, but I\u2019m still not sure who'd win in a fight between a tiger with a knife and a monkey with a crossbow.
p575
aVHappy Bastille Day!  Vive La France!  Vive La Revolution! Vive La Excuse To Get Wasted On French Beer!
p576
aVRT @ComicBookGuy: Does no one but me understand the true meaning of CosPlay? I'm the only "Fat Albert" in the entire hall! #FOXSDCC #SDCC
p577
aVPerfect family day at the beach.  The family is at the beach, and I\u2019m at home getting drunk in my hammock.
p578
aVSo it's Friday the 13th. I love 13!  It's the number of my favorite donut amount AND my favorite German prison camp!
p579
aVIt\u2019s time for me to admit it. I may be going a little bald.
p580
aVFor my money, the only really great superhero is Pizza Man. He delivers. #SDCC #FOXSDCC
p581
aVHey nerds flocking to ComicCon: thanks for leaving the movie theaters in Springfield all to me!  #Popcorngasm  #SDCC #FOXSDCC
p582
aVI\u2019m sending Bart to a summer astronomy camp called \u201cMoons Over Springfield.\u201d It\u2019s not gonna work out well for anyone.
p583
aVThere\u2019s termites in my house and it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s my wood, I\u2019m the one who should get to eat it.
p584
aVWork is fun today. Bringing a hammock was genius. Too bad the BBQ set off the sprinklers, tho: the hot dogs got soggy.
p585
aVThere go Maggie and the dog on another adventure! Last time they came back with pirate treasure. This time it better be cheese pretzels.
p586
aVMy BBQ charcoal was slow to light, so I speeded it up with some fireworks. Anyone see a flying BBQ celebrating the birth of our nation?
p587
aVOne of my ancestors crossed the Delaware with Washington, but you don\u2019t hear about him because for some reason his boat sank.
p588
aVAt the beach today, a lifeguard came up and said \u201cMa\u2019am, please put your top on.\u201d I chose to take it as a compliment.
p589
aVSuperman's birthday is this weekend. He\u2019s gonna zoom around the earth and stop time so his party goes longer. No fair, Supe.
p590
aVIt's the midpoint of the year. Bart\u2019s broken or lost all of last Xmas' toys, and started making his list of next Xmas\u2019 toys.
p591
aVIt's Bart\u2019s last day of school today. And based on his grades, it really may be.
p592
aVArmy engineers are on a training exercise in my yard. Trying to make a hammock strong enough to support me. Your taxes at work.
p593
aVDear @wolfblitzer, don't feel bad about getting the Supreme Court news wrong today. I once ate a batting practice donut.
p594
aVThe Supreme Court upheld Obamacare by a margin of 5 to 4 -- can't do better than that!
p595
aVToday might be my wedding anniversary, I\u2019m not sure but I remember it was on a weekday.
p596
aVBarney's heartbroken. The only girl drunk enough to find him attractive had to go to the ER for alcohol poisoning. #UNFAIR
p597
aVGotta tweet fast, Marge is making my favorite thing for dinner \u2013 food!
p598
aVWin or lose, this has been a great NBA championship for teams named after weather. And isn\u2019t that what sports is all about?
p599
aVSo, Miami\u2019s the champs. See other teams? All you need to win are three giant superstars. How hard is that?
p600
aVThe heat is on top of the thunder. I\u2019m not talking about basketball, I\u2019m predicting the weather tomorrow.
p601
aVSome other dads were watching me choke Bart so I gave them a turn too. Never miss a chance to teach your kids about sharing.
p602
aVJust checking: it's "Live FAT and die young", right?  I've already got the "good-looking corpse" part covered.
p603
aVCongrats on your #USOpen win to my new-found nephew @webbsimpson1! And can you loan your Uncle Homer 50K til payday?
p604
aVIn honor of National Donut Day, I'm eating my weight in donuts. And each one I eat adds more weight! #TheNeverendingGlory
p605
aVI\u2019m loading up on popcorn and candy before going to see Men In Black. There\u2019s no reason this funeral has to be boring.
p606
aVA big shout out to our Armed Forces! Thanks for preserving my freedom to spend all weekend drinking beer in a kiddie pool.
p607
aVThis Memorial Day, I honor the brave pig snouts and chicken rectums that gave their lives so I could enjoy this hot dog.
p608
aVI refuse to pay HBO for @GameOfThrones. If I wanna see a dwarf trick his way to power I can watch Bart play with Milhouse.
p609
aVEven Maggie loves @LadyGaga. In her little voice she's always saying "Gaga," along with "Abba" and "Rage Against the Machine."
p610
aV.@LadyGaga is in my town! Bet you jerks in New York, LA or her other tour stops can only dream about that happening to you. #GagaExpress
p611
aVCan't wait to meet @LadyGaga. I'm used to being around royalty from all the time I've spent at Pizza King.
p612
aVThank you @LadyGaga for BORN THIS WAY &amp; its message of acceptance. I sing it whenever Marge tells me I can't eat raw butter.
p613
aV50 million people like me!  If one of them owns a hot dog stand in Star Wars times I'll be really thrilled.
p614
aVMay is my favorite month -- and word. I MAY go to Moe\u2019s tonight. I MAY have eaten all the butter. I MAY be having a stroke.
p615
aVI cut off my blue pants into shorts for the summer. Bart called them my \u201cDaisy Pukes.\u201d So I choked him. Good times.
p616
aVARE YOU SUPPOSED TO EAT THOSE STICKERS ON APPLES? I\u2019M GUESSING YES.
p617
aVI've got 50 million likes, and one love -- beer.
p618
aVHappy Mother's Day to all you Moms. And Dads, hang in there, it\u2019s only one day and it passes quicker if you're drunk.
p619
aVOne year I gave Marge the perfect Mother\u2019s Day gift: Lisa. (I owed her something good after giving her Bart 2 years before)
p620
aVI love all the playoff games right now. I tape every one and then fast forward to the beer commercials.
p621
aVNow that the warm weather is here it\u2019s time to scrape the rust off my old lawnmower -- Grampa.
p622
aVI'm honored that 50 million of you took the time to stop looking at cat videos and click on a thumb. http://t.co/mLu33moR
p623
aVI'm bald just like Kobe and Kevin Garnett. So, how come I'm not in the NBA? Not even on Charlotte - what am I missing?
p624
aVI promised Bart that if the Jazz make the finals we're going to a game. I promised him today.
p625
aVI've got 50 million Facebook likes. Suck on that, every living President combined! http://t.co/aVsXyVvH
p626
aVThe NBA game from 3 days ago I just watched on my DVR played out just like the newspaper said it did. How about a spoiler alert paper?
p627
aVI'm glad the Spurs swept the Jazz. Marge liked there was sweeping involved. And that's how our marriage stays together.
p628
aVTwo seats at a playoff game cost 500 dollars! Boy, I sure wish I fit in just one.
p629
aVCan you believe there are no Canadian teams left in the hockey playoffs? That's like the US Army not being in any wars!

aVI\u2019ve actually been clocked faster than a Kentucky Derby horse during the race to the donut cart.

p643
aVCongratulations, Oregon.  Your taxes will pay for my jail time.
p644
aVCrap, we live in Oregon?  I mean, Go Ducks!
p645
aVI don\u2019t know what state we live in, but our house is worth a lot less than in 2007.

aVNow that Bart knows we live in The Beaver State, all he says is dam dam dam!
p647
aVDo you think if the Simpsons lived in Oregon Grampa wouldn\u2019t have been suicided a long time ago?

aVWell, that's it -- I lost!  Good night.
p657
aVHere we go!  I've got a good feeling about my picks!
p658
aVI'm rooting for Melissa McCarthy. If she wins, it'll be a Rosa Parks moment for me and sink-poopers everywhere.  #Oscars
p659
aVI'm glad Billy Crystal's the host. Every moment he's doing the #Oscars is one he's not gassing on about knowing Mickey Mantle.
p660
aVI've got a huge bet riding on the #Oscars.  If I'm not in the Death Montage then Dr. Hibbert owes me big $$!
p661
aVI have a Grammy, Oscar & Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement In The Field Of Excellence. Half-way to EGOMBAFOAITFOET!
p662
aVI'm really looking forward to my 500th episode! That's when that coupon for one free night at the Cardiac ICU kicks in.
p663
aVI don't get the fuss about Presidents Day. I spend my whole life not living up to promises and nobody's giving me a holiday.
p664
aVIf February is the cruelest month, then Rocktober is the coolest month. And January is the hottest Jones.
p665
aVLadies, you know how every year you find chocolates in your Valentine's Day box you just can't stand? Please send them to me.
p666
aVIt all worked out great. Marge loved her flowers, and I got lucky -- she didn't find out I stole them from Flanders' yard!
p667
aVQuick! I need some flowers and chocolates ASAP. It's a matter of sex life and sex death!
p668
aVMarge is so cool, she doesn't mind that I'm sending her this tweet instead of giving her a Valentine's Day card, I assume.
p669
aVI can't wait for the premiere of SMASH. It's about time the Hulk got his own show again.
p670
aVCongrats to the true Patriots and their Giant victory! Auto-tweeted cuz I'm planning on falling asleep before the game ends.
p671
aVI just lost a week's salary betting on The Puppy Bowl. Stupid Labradoodle couldn't cover!
p672
aVBest of luck to my End Zone Celebration student Tom Brady, and to a guy who once appeared in Bart's daydream, Eli Manning!
p673

p674
aVIn Super Bowl talk my pants are only size L!
p675
aVI'm rooting against any team with that Ochocinco guy. Now if I want to have my name changed to my IQ, it's already taken.
p676
aVI'm one of those weird people who watch the Super Bowl just to see the game.
p677
aVI bet people who love this mild winter either don't have dogs or don't want a 3 month break from picking up their poop.
p678
aVWait, now it's National Chocolate Cake Day?!  America, are you trying to kill me?  Also, thank you.
p679
aVI don't need Obama to tell me the State Of The Union. I can judge that by the number of fruity yogurt shops on the same block.
p680
aVI'm upset about the Oscar nominations. I thought they were for the best bologna!  #JustAJoke #ImNotReallyThatStoopit
p681
aVOkay, just one: "It's cobblerin' time!" #NationalPieDay
p682
aVCan't tweet today: all fingers and thumbs busy eating pie. #NationalPieDay
p683
aVI can't believe Wikipedia isn't working today. Now how will I make people believe I was the 2003 AL Rookie Of The Year?
p684
aVI think I might be a robot. But if I can think at all, probably not, right? Man, maybe being a robot is confusing.
p685
aV46 jelly donuts = one daily serving of fruit. Someone tell the food pyramid.
p686
aVBad news from doctor today. He still knows I haven\u2019t paid my bill.
p687
aVI took dancing lessons from the Fox football robot. Went well, but Marge doesn't like how I keep spiking her purse.
p688
aVJust got banned from the local petting zoo. I got into a fight with a goat over the food the little kids were handing out.
p689
aVStupid modern cars. Whenever I sit in the passenger seat the air bag begs to be disabled.
p690
aVThe secrets to staying young: exercise, openness to new experience, and a wizard with a spell that keeps you young chained in your basement.
p691
aVThought about shaving my head, but who has the time?
p692
aVSad to say goodbye to 2011 calendar with circus clowns every month.  2012 calendar, you have some big shoes to fill!
p693
aV2012! A year named after my net worth! (Assuming couch change and oil being made from my blubber).
p694
aVFortune cookies = the original tweet delivery system.
p695
aVSo glad basketball is back. I worried about all those poor, unemployed millionaires.
p696
aVJust realized my side hairs grow in the shape of \u201cM\u201ds. That or my barber is secretly Zorro.
p697
aVDoing donuts on the icy winter roads. That\u2019s sort of a lie. I\u2019m actually eating donuts in the bathtub.
p698
aVMy fantasy football team sucks. Just realizing I probably shouldn\u2019t have only drafted cheerleaders.
p699
aVFound out Bart secretly asked for a gun for Xmas. I\u2019ve spent all night trying to keep Santa away by farting up the chimney.
p700
aVI had nosebleed seats for a Denver game and Tebow kept pointing to me after each touchdown. I get it Tim, you dig me.
p701
aVI love the holiday colors on the nuclear plant cooling towers -- eerie radioactive green and flickering flame red. It\u2019s cheery!
p702
aVThis line to see Santa takes forever, but I\u2019m finally at the front. Wait, I forgot something... dammit, the kids!
p703
aVI think Moe may be the Grinch. He\u2019s frighteningly ugly and he\u2019s ruining Christmas -- by closing the bar on December 25.
p704
aVDear Houston Texans, your name helped Bart pass a geography test. He\u2019d have aced it if Seattle was in a state named "Seahawk."
p705
aVI\u2019m trying to buy the stuff on Lisa\u2019s Xmas list. Does anyone know a store that sells \u201can end to world famine?\u201d Walmart, maybe?
p706
aVGreat Hanukah party small talk: Is a latke a pancake made FROM a potato or FOR a potato? You\u2019re welcome.
p707
aVIt\u2019s Christmas time \u2013 that means it\u2019s not only okay for me to slip liquor into dairy-based beverages; it\u2019s encouraged!
p708
aVHappy Hanukah from Homer.  I bet that taught my "H" key who's boss.
p709
aVWhy does Marge ask me what I want for Christmas every year? The answer\u2019s always the same: five billion dollars.
p710
aVHanukah candles start tomorrow. If you're a Jewish arsonist, good news - you\u2019re about to go on an awesome 8 day bender!
p711
aVI'm still writing "2011" on checks. Wait, don't read this until January.
p712
aVMay be time for a diet - I take an XXXXL in a Santa suit.
p713
aVThese days I do all my Xmas shopping on line.  Right now I\u2019m on a huge Kwik-E-Mart line to buy Lotto scratchers for Maggie.
p714
aVStupid Flanders is just now getting around to putting up his Xmas lights.  I've had mine up for 3 years!
p715
aVIt's National Pastry Day: a time to remember the millions of brave Danish who gave their lives so I might get a little fatter.
p716
aVCalling all foosballers: can I have some of my money back?
p717
aVCalling all foosballers: I\u2019ve got a table in my basement and I\u2019ll take on anybody. For money!
p718
aVIs there a kind of doctor that specializes in hands that are cramping up from strangling their son\u2019s scrawny neck? A friend asks.
p719
aVNote to everyone NOT following me on Twitter \u2013 how are you reading this?
p720
aVThis weekend my whole family was entertained by that lovable bunch of silly puppets:  it was a rerun of the Republican debate.
p721
aVForget Black Friday and Cyber Monday -- I'm looking forward to Slurred Speech Saturday and Sleep It Off Sunday.
p722
aVOn Black Friday I love to laugh at the idiots crowding the mall. It's so worth the 3 hour wait for a parking spot to open up.
p723
aVDear \u201cGenius Turkey\u201d that beat me at checkers: I\u2019m playing my Thanksgiving dinner and have already won 6 games in a row. Payback!
p724
aVThis Thanksgiving I\u2019m grateful Mr. Burns never notices I always leave at 11 AM. So thank you cataracts, I owe you one.
p725
aVIf anyone knows a genie granting 3 wishes, please tell them I\u2019m interested (will pay 1 wish for referral).
p726
aVFirst frost of the fall. A magic white veil covers the piles of dirt in the backyard where we buried Bart\u2019s many unsuccessful hamsters.
p727
aVToday is \u201cnational adoption day.\u201d I\u2019m putting Bart on the curb. Help yourself, America.
p728
aVTo anyone else in this traffic jam: I have pork chops. If you have gravy and biscuits, let\u2019s meet at the green car for a light snack.
p729
aVI\u2019m sick of our cat and its hairballs. Anyone want to adopt it? It comes with three clingy human children who keep yelling \u201cno, daddy no.\u201d
p730
aVBarney\u2019s leg is stuck in the toilet. Someone call for help but tell them not to get here until it stops being hilarious.
p731
aVTo Beer, I love you. From a secret admirer. Okay, it\u2019s me. Secret\u2019s out.
p732
aVJust learned my car isn\u2019t as fast as a train. And that it\u2019s hard to drive on train tracks. And that I can tweet from an ambulance!
p733
aVNY Jets are my favorite team since Rex Ryan and I wear the same size pants. Go Jets! Go 53 inch waistlines!
p734
aVI just invented the word \u201cflozjulate\u201d and now I need someone to define it for me. I think it could be big. Bigger than \u201cincentivize.\u201d
p735
aVToday we salute our veterans. There's no greater sacrifice, as I know from my days as a Cat-Sergeant in the Kiss Army.
p736
aVThis Veterans Day I\u2019m saluting our brave warriors by not taking my usual high-speed shortcut through the VA parking lot.
p737
aVMy heart goes out to Rick Perry. I sometimes forget the names of one of my two kids.
p738
aVDon't blame me: I voted for Ralph Wiggum.  #GOPdebate
p739
aVMy daughters are very different. For example, one\u2019s older. There\u2019s probably more differences, but I think I\u2019ve proved my point.
p740
aVDon\u2019t tell Marge I\u2019m on Twitter. She thinks she\u2019s the only one who gets to know my innermost and stupidmost thoughts.
p741
aVThat show "The Walking Dead" is so dumb. NOT having to walk is the main reason I look forward to death!
p742
aVI feel so awful for that guy on "Boardwalk Empire" with only half a face. He can't enjoy meatball subs! What kind of life is that?
p743
aVI was raking leaves and I came across the six pack of beer I hid in last year\u2019s leaf pile. You\u2019re a genius, Last Year Me!
p744
aVTo guy in red shirt. I\u2019m walking behind you for \u201cFollow Friday.\u201d Hey, nice house. Is this the bedroom? Why is your wife screaming? #FF
p745
aVI hear President Obama has a program for underwater mortgage holders, which is great because I just broke the upstairs toilet.
p746
aVSo I went to Google and then ate a barrel of rolls. Nothing happened. What gives? I feel sick.
p747
aVI don\u2019t trust Republican candidate Herman Cain. What kind of man voluntarily quits as boss of a pizza company?
p748
aVFlanders doesn't let his kids go Trick Or Treating. More stale candy corn for me!
p749
aVRemember when you were a kid & one jerk always turned his lights out and pretended to not be home on Halloween night? That's me!
p750
aVI love the night before Halloween -- I can egg Flanders' house and blame it on punks! Of course I egg MY house too to preserve my alibi.
p751
aVAs a responsible parent I always accompany my kids when they Trick or Treat. For which I exact a 10% "Keeping You Alive Fee" in candy.
p752
aVOctober is my favorite month \u2013 the baseball games, Halloween and, best of all, I\u2019m a fat loser! (DICTATED TO BART, BUT NOT READ)
p753
aVI like that Herman Cain guy. But I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019ll be able to juggle being President and solving crimes on CSI: Miami.
p754
aVOctober is National Pork Month but I ate it all September \u2013 sorta like a tailgate party before the big game.
p755
aVI\u2019m leading the Occupy Evergreen Terrace movement. I\u2019m gonna lie on my hammock until Bart gets a job. #ows
p756
aVI miss NBA basketball\u2026 incredible athletes doing amazing feats...  I\u2019m talking about the guys who have to sell me beer in the stands.
p757
aVIf you\u2019re missing basketball, come watch me in the bathroom.  The occasional dunk, but mostly just dribbling on the floor.
p758
aVBaseball players say a tie is \u201clike kissing your sister,\u201d well a horrific bear attack is like kissing Marge\u2019s sister.
p759
aVPlease end the NBA lockout.  I need basketball on the TV at Moe\u2019s bar to distract me from the horror of looking at the other barflies.
p760
aVOh the poor super-rich NBA owners and their overpaid stars. They don\u2019t give a damn for the real losers: giant megacorporation TV networks.
p761
aVThe Cardinals have a guy with a funny name: Albert Pujols. Heh-heh\u2026 Albert.
p762
aVTwo terrible lockouts happening this fall: the NBA owners locking out their players, and Marge putting a padlock on our pie cabinet.
p763
aVI\u2019m making a World Series bet with the Mayors of St. Louis and Dallas. Whoever wins, I will eat lots of steak and drink lots of beer.
p764
aVI\u2019m honored that the Commissioner of Baseball has named me the ceremonial first drunk to be thrown out of the World Series.
p765
aVI'm rooting for Texas in the World Series. I can't forgive St. Louis for their "Beer City on Beer City" violence against Milwaukee.
p766
aVCongratulations to the American League champions Yankees/Rangers/Tigers/Rays! (NOTE: GET OFF FAT ASS AND PUT IN RIGHT ONES BEFORE TWEETING)
p767
aVIn honor of World Food Day, please remember the kids who go to bed hungry every night. Mine.
p768
aVYesterday was World Food Day. Or as I call it, Sunday.
p769
aVMy political donation to Buddy Roemer was a big mistake. I was trying to give Buddy Ebsen money to make more Barnaby Joneses.
p770
aVInteresting coincidence:  1492 is the year Columbus discovered America and also my most recent blood pressure.
p771
aVWhen Columbus discovered it, it was the New World.  Now it\u2019s old and has bad hips.
p772
aVIt's Columbus Day.  If there\u2019s a holiday honoring  Columbus, shouldn\u2019t there be one honoring MacMillan and Wife?
p773
aVHey, Canadians, don\u2019t forget to give thanks to me\u2014I\u2019ve funneled millions of dollars into your back bacon industry.
p774
aVCanada has Thanksgiving on October 10, so I\u2019m headed south of the border!
p775
aVTo counter all the unfounded rumors going around about me, let me set the record straight: I am NOT running for President.
p776
aVI'm in a big negotiation but I finally struck a deal: a new 2 year cell phone contract. Now the hard part, choosing the funniest ring tone.
p777
aVGlad to see Simon Cowell has bounced back after being fired from "American Chopper".
p778
aVMarge tells me "The X Factor" is not porno but an English guy yelling at people trying to sing.  Which to me is an incredible turn-on.
p779
aVI'm so excited to watch that new porno show on Fox, "The X Factor!"
p780
aVYou know the small print on car commercials that says "Professional driver on closed course, do not attempt"?   I'm the reason for that!
p781
aVThe first person I saw when I opened my eyes was my loving Dad.  So I shut my eyes and faked another 11 hours of coma.
p782
aV. @MimiChan82 My coma was medically induced:  I slammed my station wagon head-on into an ambulance.
p783
aVI'm back!  I can't tell you what kind of great summer I had.  Because I spent most of it in a coma.

aVI\u2019m a man of the world: I eat like an American, drink like a German, relax like a Frenchman and don\u2019t pay taxes like a Swiss guy.
p834
aVI went to Moe's and he was doing his taxes. He files a 1040 Slee-Z form. I paid Bart 5000 bucks for that joke -- work expense!
p835
aVIt\u2019s easy to balance the budget. Soak the rich, screw the poor, and give me whatever\u2019s left over, in the form of butter-fried lard bacon.
p836
aVI think both the Democrats and Republicans did a great job fixing the budget. In case you didn't realize, I typed this sarcastically.
p837
aVThere\u2019s something fishy at the Masters. Tiger Woods was beaten by Charl Schwartzel from South Africa? Phony name, phony country!
p838
aVJust bowled a perfect 300 -- 300 ounces of beer and still managed to finish the game.
p839
aVI saw Lisa make a potato clock in school, so when my phone battery died I replaced it with an order of french fries. Don\u2019t bother calling.
p840
aVI ate two slices and then realized my pizza looked just like pac-man. So this is what a religious experience feels like.
p841
aVBart is studying ancient Rome in school, and he says my Roman name would be Lamewadius Maximus. Woo hoo! I\u2019m the maximus of a thing.
p842
aVNothing better than sitting on the couch in your underwear. I'm gonna enjoy this until the department store security guys show up.
p843
aVBart is really falling down on the job. He promised to retweet anything clever I say but so far he hasn\u2019t retweeted tweet one.
p844
aVNow that I'm one of @TIME Magazine's 140 Most Influential Tweeters, I command you to go out and bring me beer.  http://ti.me/fuYSX6
p845
aVWoo hoo! @TIME put me on their list of the 140 best Twitter feeds. http://ti.me/dWPV1e http://ti.me/fuYSX6 Suck on that, @BarackObama
p846
aVIn Bizarro Springfield, I\u2019m the idiot.
p847
aVWhat\u2019s the big deal with the budget deficit? The president should do like me: photocopy money. He can probably afford a color copier.
p848
aVMarch is hump month. Halfway between the horror of Christmas holidays and the nightmare of summer vacation.
p849
aVMy turn to do laundry. Oh please, great Mayan doomsday, come early.
p850
aVMarch is a tough month. Only two pro sports. I need four at least to justify my daytime drinking and hooting.
p851
aVA lot of upheaval in the middle-east. Specifically my middle east - I just ate six tacos.
p852
aVYou enjoyed St. Patrick\u2019s Day, now celebrate St. Homer\u2019s Day: he drove the Flanders out of Springfield. (They came back.)
p853
aVEither I just met a delightful Leprechaun, or I got mugged by a vicious 9 year old.
p854
aVWhadda hell you lookindat?! Voaeu7045r70a39auytonfancnma;!!
p855
aVHappy St. Patrick's Day to all my Irish friends! (Typed while sober the night before.)
p856
aVIf the Libyans need someone to replace Ghaddafi, I\u2019m available. Wait, he\u2019s a vicious strongman? I thought you wanted a vichyssoise fatman.
p857
aVHope your omens are good on the Ides of March. Mine are terrible -- I\u2019m too fat for my toga.
p858
aVFebruary is great, because it\u2019s the shortest month and before you know it, you\u2019re in -- oh, dammit, March?!! I hate that month!
p859
aVWoo-hoo shortest month! If the calendar is the NBA, then good luck getting off the bench
p860
aVI can't believe the #Oscars snubbed whatever the hell Adam Sandler movie I saw that time.
p861
aVI hope Toy Story 3 wins Best Picture. And, for shutting my kids up for 90 minutes, it should get the Nobel Prize. #Oscars
p862
aVTonight all of Hollywood will be clamoring for a naked yellow man with a little sword. Sounds like my bedroom every night. #Oscars
p863
aVTo answer every Oscar-watcher's favorite question: Tonight I'm wearing spilled Duff with splattered pasta sauce highlights. #Oscars
p864
aVTonight are the Independent Spirit Awards -- the cute little singer/songwriter opening act for the King of Rock that is The #Oscars.
p865
aVThe countdown is on! Only 24 hours till I stop seeing a million commercials for "The King's Speech" every night. #Oscars
p866
aVIt's #Oscars Eve, which means it's time to hang the swag bags by the fireplace in hopes that Saint Nicolas Cage will fill them with iPads.
p867
aVSomewhere somebody is tweeting the Arab Revolutions, but you\u2019re following a man playing with his own man-boobs. Cootchie cootchie!
p868
aVFebruary. Maybe on a leap year you could play, but still only during garbage time.
p869
aV...I just found it. Or some of it.
p870
aVI'm at Moe's watching Barney get his stomach pumped by EMTs. If anyone lost a wedding ring with the inscription "Love, Carol," ...
p871
aVIf I had a time machine, I'd let other people worry about saving Abraham Lincoln. I'd tell my young self to eat more Pixie Stix.
p872
aVDon\u2019t tell my family about events in Egypt.  I don\u2019t want them getting ideas about deposing an abusive dictator who eats all the dates.
p873
aVI wish I had wooden teeth like George Washington. Never have to brush, just paint occasionally.
p874
aVI learn a lot of history at car dealerships. For example, Lincoln was an inflatable giant with fast-flapping arms who liked you to buy cars.
p875
aVIf Lincoln was alive today he could make a ton of money working as a Lincoln-impersonating robot. #presidentsday
p876
aVAll I know about basketball is that the better a player is, the more tattoos he can afford. That Kat Von D lady must be awesome!
p877
aVGame\u2019s on Lakers court cause fans are used to games with no defense. Take that Staples Center engineer who said I won\u2019t fit in a seat!
p878
aV40 years ago, I stepped on a scale in Florida. That day, the term Daytona 500 was coined.
p879
aVDaytona today! 500 miles. I don't know how those guys do it - I could never drive that far while sober.
p880
aVThe real slam dunk contest is going on between my donut and my beer. Mmm, soggy.
p881
aVA computer may have won Jeopardy, but it\u2019ll never replace me. Unlike me, computers feel shame when they do a terrible job.
p882
aVOn this day in 1930, Pluto was discovered. Happy birthday, from one recovering planetary body to another.
p883
aVWoke up from a deep sleep at 6 AM and it felt really great. Probably cause I was driving home from Moe's right at that time.
p884
aVIf there's one thing I've learned from being a father, it's nothing.
p885
aVJust read something shocking - donut holes are made separate, not taken from donuts. Thanks Wikileaks, you did it again.
p886
aVCongrats to @ArcadeFire on their Grammy. I caused an Arcade Fire once when I walked through an arcade while wearing corduroys. #Grammys
p887
aVIt\u2019s irresponsible and dangerous to text and drive. Next time, do what I do -- pull your car over.  Then make Bart drive while you type.
p888
aVFor our special Valentine\u2019s Day dinner, we\u2019re having Prix Fixe by Chef Henri, Death by Chocolate, and Heimlich by Springfield Paramedics.
p889
aVI was gonna wear a sexy thong for Valentine\u2019s Day, but it turns out any piece of underwear looks tiny when it\u2019s on my giant ass.
p890
aVHey Lenny, where\u2019s my Valentine\u2019s Day card.  Gestures matter, you know.
p891
aVI\u2019m rooting for Eminem. If he wins, it might open the door for other singers named after candy. #Grammys
p892
aVAs a former #Grammys winner, I\u2019m going to be in that \u201cPeople Who Died\u201d montage someday. I only hope I live long enough to see it.
p893
aV.@LadyGaga is the greatest genius of our time. Her meat dress made the dream of food-based clothing a reality. And I hear she sings, too.
p894
aVAs a past recipient, I have some advice for tonight's winners: don't try to use the trophy as a gold ice cream cone. #Grammys
p895
aVShoveling snow is a great way to exercise.  I burned 5 calories ordering Bart to do it.
p896
aVMLK inspired us to make our dreams come true, which is why I\u2019m sleeping on a waterbed made of donuts & filled with beer. #blackhistorymonth
p897
aVHey, when is yellow history month? I hope it's not Tuesday - I have a bowling match. #blackhistorymonth
p898
aVShould've bet GB instead of on Carl eating 1000 peanuts. I tried to coach him through his nut allergy. Sure hope the ER doctors can.
p899
aVCongratulations Packers, you did it. Now the bad news, you still live in Green Bay. #superbowl
p900
aVI guess it's all about who wants it more. #superbowl
p901
aVThe big game today; me versus sobriety. Sobriety has lost 10 years in a row and things don\u2019t look good this year -
p902
aVWell, well, so the world championship comes down to teams from Pittsburgh & Green Bay. Suck on that, rest of the world!
p903
aVIt's expensive but it makes the sponsors happy and that's what sports is about. #superbowl
p904
aVMy little tradition when watching the big game. I buy everything that's advertised.
p905
aVI\u2019m trapped in my car in a blizzard. If I die, donate my body to science, preferably an experiment to see how much beer a corpse can drink.
p906
aVHappy New Year to my Chinese friends. And happy nothing to most people I know.
p907
aVAlso, if alcohol poisoning counts, maybe a purple heart.
p908
aVBarney just burped the national anthem \u2013 he\u2019s a patriot and deserves a Kennedy Center honor.
p909
aVChinese New Year today. Geez, think how short their Ryan Seacrest must be.
p910
aVSo the groundhog didn\u2019t see his shadow. Big deal. Thanks to my fat, I haven\u2019t seen anything on the ground for ten years.
p911
aVI wish my Groundhog Day would be repeated over and over because I just found a three week old sandwich in the sofa.
p912
aVI had a great time clearing the walk with my new snow blower. Except now I can\u2019t find the dog.
p913
aVThanks to the cold weather, I can keep my beer cool outside. Fridge limits on my drunkenness no longer apply!
p914
aVBlack ice on the road: the perfect excuse to slide through an intersection without stopping.
p915
aVIf global warming is so real, shouldn\u2019t I be seeing more than one camel roaming the wintertime streets of Springfield?
p916
aVNow is a great time to service your air conditioner in preparation for the summer, and next month is a great time to forget to pay the bill.
p917
aVI'm not asleep, I just work best with my eyes closed. I guess I'm like an airplane pilot in that sense.
p918
aVMy kids have buried me inside a snow fort. Send help and beer.
p919
aVWinter tip: tie a keg of beer around your dog\u2019s neck, so he can save you in case you\u2019re buried in an avalanche without being drunk enough.
p920
aV2 meltdowns at the nuclear plant today - one nuclear, one ice-cream cone. Both very sad but only one rocky road.
p921
aVIt was the home video of Lisa and me at \u201cTake Your Daughter To Work Day.\u201d
p922
aVThis weekend I watched a movie about a girl and a fat, over-the-hill drunk who kills people...
p923
aVYou know how the \u201cexperts\u201d say you should always steer your car into a skid? Turns out, they\u2019re right.
p924
aVAnother milestone: my butt cheeks now expand over three airline seats.
p925
aVThey say no two snowflakes are exactly alike. The same goes for belches.
p926
aVMy year-end performance rating at work: \u201cworse than strapping a corpse to the workstation.\u201d Big improvement. Last year I rated \u201cmuch worse.\u201d
p927
aVIt was so cold today. When Marge shoveled the sidewalk, I could see her breath all the way from the living room couch.
p928
aVStomach pumped, heart-restarted, I'm a new man with his priorities straight. Did they introduce Miss Golden Globes yet? #GoldenGlobes
p929
aVHi, this is Marge. Homer had to go to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. Thanks a lot, Hollywood phonies! #GoldenGlobes
p930
aVI'm playing a #GoldenGlobes drinking game: I'm gonna chug a beer every time I see a nominee pretend to be humble.
p931
aVI'm a big fan of "Boardwalk Empire," because it stars two of my all-time favorites: beer and cotton candy. #GoldenGlobes
p932
aVI'm really rooting for "Inception." If it wins, I'm hoping it paves the way for Hollywood to make more pro-sleeping movies. #GoldenGlobes
p933
aVI love the #GoldenGlobes. They're like the Oscars of movie award shows.
p934
aVLike Rex Ryan I also have a fetish, but the feet I'm into is six-foot party subs. #NFL
p935
aVI'd root against him but I'm not sure Mark Sanchez is a real jet either. #NFL
p936
aVIf Tom Brady was a real Patriot, he'd marry an American supermodel. #NFL
p937
aVChicago vs. Seattle = Pizza vs. coffee = Gangsters versus fishermen = Ferris Bueller vs. Bill Gates. Oh, I give up, math is hard. #NFL
p938
aV...our other kids.
p939
aVAmerica\u2019s greatest hope is our kids, because only they will have the strength and knowledge to defeat America\u2019s greatest threat...
p940
aVLots of football this weekend. That means also lots of my other favorite sport - ignoring the kids!  #NFL
p941
aVAh, January, or as I call it, \u201cExchange All the Ugly, Ill-fitting Sweaters You Got as Gifts for an X-rated Video Game\u201d Month.
p942
aVIt\u2019s always confusing remembering the new date. Mr Burns is still writing \u201c2011 B.C.\u201d on his checks.
p943
aVThis year the holidays ended at 2 AM.
p944
aVI really know the holidays are over when I\u2019ve thrown the old Christmas tree over the fence into Flanders' yard.
p945
aVI love how the best colleges have the worst football teams \u2013 take that nerds! #Oregon #Auburn
p946
aVIf you're the quarterback on the blue team and you're reading this, you're about to get sacked. Oh, forget it. #Auburn
p947
aVStupid Flanders busted in my garage window! I\u2019m gonna sue him as soon as I get out of Intensive Care.
p948
aVI\u2019m warming the car up in my garage. My warm, cozy, completely enclosed garage.  So warm\u2026 so odorless\u2026 so sleepy\u2026
p949
aVSo far this year has started pretty much like the last one ended - me watching football and ignoring the kids. #CottonBowl
p950
aVI'm glad it's a new year. I did something embarrassing last year I'm trying to move past - I paid to see \u201cYogi Bear.\u201d
p951
aVDrunk. It\u2019s always New Years somewhere, right?
p952
aVMy new year\u2019s resolution - gain 50 pounds. It won't be easy but I'm just gonna take it one beer-battered bacon sundae at a time.
p953
aVI\u2019m getting all ready to watch the sugar bowl tonight.  I think Bart\u2019s been stealing from it.
p954
aVOMG! First #Usher steals my physique, now this! http://bit.ly/eEpQWz
p955
aV.@UsherRaymondIV, thanks to you I\u2019m finally famous! You totally have permission to cover my song at the Grammys. http://tinyurl.com/2cnwgqw
p956
aVNew Year\u2019s Resolution #5: learn to hibernate, and then do it.\u2070\u2070
p957
aVYou can have your parade float made of roses.  I\u2019d like a float made of beer cans.  They last longer.  And they contain beer.
p958
aVI have no pants, my legs are covered in vomit, and my left side is paralyzed.  Looks like for once I didn\u2019t overdo it on New Years Eve.
p959
aVToday\u2019s kids don\u2019t know a world without computers.  My kids do -- and I plan to keep it that way.
p960
aVI don\u2019t like Cher because her name reminds me of something I don\u2019t like doing.
p961
aVMan, I wish I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve said, \u201cI wish I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve said\u201d something.
p962
aVI\u2019d want a teddy bear for adults but stuffed with ham and devilled eggs instead of foam. You\u2019re not long for this world, bear.
p963
aVI just invented \u201cThe Homer Simpson diet\u201d: eat cheeseburgers until you die, after which the pounds melt off.
p964
aVI applied for a job in \u201cThe Land that Time Forgot\u201d \u2018cause I figured no one there would notice when I show up late.
p965
aVSorry, fell asleep. Hey, how come you\u2019re not running?
p966
aVI\u2019m in the core trying to stop a meltdown.  If you don\u2019t get a tweet from me every five minutes, I\u2019m dead and you should run for your lives!
p967
aVYou know who doesn\u2019t get a lot of credit? Marge Simpson. And who doesn\u2019t she get a lot of credit from? Her entire family.
p968
aVAccording to Bart, my brain is so wooden it\u2019s under attack by pine beetles. Is this possible? \u2018Cause it sounds scary.
p969
aVMaggie is so lucky. I wish someone would trap me in a chair and shove mush in my face.
p970
aVCleaning is so tiring. I constantly have to lift my feet so Marge can vacuum underneath them. What is this, Alcatraz?
p971
aVI\u2019ve been tweeting for over a year now. After beer and Marge, this has been my most successful long-term relationship.
p972
aVClassic college football rivalries: Army-Navy, Harvard-Yale, and Homer-Bart, for control of the TV remote on Saturday afternoons.
p973
aVHere\u2019s a sure tip for fantastic sex: let the 21 year olds do it.
p974
aVPlanet of the Apes -- big deal. Let the apes revolt. I can pass for a gorilla.
p975
aVI love that sweet alone time after dumping the kids at school but before going to work. That\u2019s why I pray for traffic every day.
p976
aVCouldn\u2019t wait. If you want him, he\u2019s outside, chained to the mailbox.
p977
aVOffer doesn't have to be reasonable.
p978
aVBeer doesn't have to be cold. No reasonable offer refused.
p979
aVWill trade 10 year old boy for cold beer.
p980
aVI\u2019m having dinner with Marge in a swanky restaurant. Couldn\u2019t find a sitter so left the kids with the parking valet. We\u2019ll double tip him.
p981
aVWays I\u2019d like to die: drowned in nacho cheese sauce, or shot by a bullet made of frozen beer.
p982
aVIf I was an alien with a death ray, I wouldn\u2019t *call* it a death ray, I\u2019d call it a *love* ray. Then, when you were least expecting it: zap!
p983
aVDid you ever think about computers? Some guy did or else we wouldn't have them. Think about that.
p984
aVI\u2019ve decided to start a realistic diet: at most eight gallons of ice cream a night. Oh, I\u2019ll never do that, make it ten.
p985
aVChomp, chomp, chomp... hey, wait a minute. If I\u2019m trying to eat my cell phone, what did I just tweet on my turkey leg?
p986
aVI saw a funny thing today but I'm not telling what it is or everyone would be laughing about it.
p987
aVSave the whales! And by whales, I mean me. Save me!
p988
aVI wish I was a Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice. When the Sorcerer was out I\u2019d steal from his magic refrigerator that never runs out of cold cuts.
p989
aVThat time I said \u201cBye\u201d and
p990
aVShe\u2019s pretty mad. I really better stop tweeting. Bye.
p991
aVOkay, I figured it out. She wasn\u2019t saying anything, just screaming at me for tweeting while she\u2019s stuck.
p992
aVOh, actually she wasn\u2019t saying \u201chi\u201d at all, but \u201chelp.\u201d Her dress is caught in the dishwasher.
p993
aVSorry, She wasn\u2019t saying \u201chi\u201d to you, but the guy next to you.
p994
aVMarge says \u201chi.\u201d
p995
aVI like the center seat on planes, so I can slop over into the seats on either side. It\u2019s a great way to meet your fellow passengers.
p996
aVDonovan McNabb went to the Redskins with high hopes, immediately got into trouble, & now can\u2019t get anything done. Washington strikes again.
p997
aVEarly to beer, early to wine, makes a man sleepy, weepy, but fun.
p998
aVA tip to remember it\u2019s cold in the fall. Every month ends with \u201cbrrr\u201d: Septembrr, Octobrr, Novembrr. Another way to remember: look outside.
p999
aVI love cold fall weather. It\u2019s like living in a refrigerator but roomier and without it stinking of tuna salad.
p1000
aVWhy do kids need backpacks? I stored a crayon in my head for 30 years and it didn\u2019t affect me one bib.
p1001
aVIt\u2019s getting cold and people are gonna need wool sweaters, so if you\u2019re a sheep, fair warning, get ready to be shorn. You\u2019re welcome.
p1002
aVDid you know I played a little pro football? On Special teams. I was the guy who licked up the Gatorade after they dumped it on the coach.
p1003
aVMy fantasy football team isn\u2019t doing very well.  That\u2019s not the way I fantasized it!
p1004
aVAmericans are doing less daylight saving these days. It's all credit. A rich guy told me that joke, but I don't get it.
p1005
aVI faked sick from work the same day Bart faked sick to stay home from school. That\u2019s how we both learned genetics are a real thing.
p1006
aVI just took Marge on a fabulous anniversary date in \u201cSecond Life.\u201d I got sex from Virtual Marge, but from real Marge, nada.
p1007
aVMy tip to keep summer alive; wear your bathing suit to work. It works unless you\u2019re a lifeguard.
p1008
aVMarge and Lisa like to go for a drive to see the different color leaves.  I help by not going with them and yelling \u201cboring!\u201d
p1009
aVYeah, I've read some of those classical tell-me-stuffs.
p1010
aVI heard some USC football players got into trouble at a frat party. Once again, some Greeks are destroying the Trojans.
p1011
aVMoe\u2019s special fall beer comes out today. He calls it that \u2018cause if you drink some, you \u201cautumn\u201d get to a hospital, fast.
p1012
aVMy fantasy football team: the players are beers, coach is a burger and the field is bacon. What am I gonna fantasize about - Tom Brady?
p1013
aVIt\u2019s nice to see Favre still playing. Gives hope to the rest of us that we can hang around long after everyone is sick of us.
p1014
aVI\u2019m in the Decontamination Room at the nuclear plant, snapping my Level-IV radiation scrub towel at Lenny\u2019s pechangas.
p1015
aVI predict America\u2019s first cyborg will be half teenager, half texting smartphone.
p1016
aVJust read the book \u201cInto Thin Air\u201d, which describes where Marge\u2019s words go when she\u2019s nagging at me to do chores.
p1017
aVWell, it\u2019s been over three months, but I\u2019ve finally completed Maggie\u2019s jigsaw puzzle. Hint: clown face UP.
p1018
aVIt\u2019s nice to see Favre still playing. Gives hope to the rest of us that we can hang around long after everyone is sick of us
p1019
aVI root for my alma mater, Springfield U. We\u2019ve never had wealthy alumni cause recruiting violations, because we *have* no wealthy alumni.
p1020
aVMy hands get dry from choking Bart, but then his tears make a great moisturizer.  Amazing, it's like evolution knows.
p1021
aVHomer salutes the Texas Rangers on their great season! Now you're the second thing to be a lot better without George Bush in charge.
p1022
aVHomer's tribute to baseball salutes the New York Yankees! By taking the fun out of winning, you made it easier for me to embrace losing.
p1023
aVI loved "Mike & Molly" -- finally a show about normal skinny people like me.
p1024
aVMy summer goal was to eat my weight in hot dogs, but I failed. Every time I ate one, my weight went up. That\u2019s cheating, hot dogs!
p1025
aVI'm a big fan of New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady. Which Brady kid was he? Bobby? Marsha?
p1026
aVI once tried out for an NFL team, but they turned me down, because based on my IQ testing I had already had eight concussions.
p1027
aVMy favorite college football division is the Big Twelve, which I watch with the Fat Twelve \u2013 twelve full size bologna sausages.
p1028
aVThe days are getting shorter now but so is Grandpa. I\u2019ve decided to ignore both those facts.
p1029
aVFor fine dining, try the back booth at Krusty Burger. It\u2019s where the fryer grease splatters when they pull out a basket of fries.
p1030
aVSaw the horror movie \u201cDate Night.\u201d This is why I tell Marge our date nights should be me watching wrestling while she makes waffles.
p1031
aVMarge spent an hour last night watching "The Event":  me trying to get up off the couch.
p1032
aVI hear this year big changes are happening on "House" -- now he's gonna be wrong SIX times before finally being right.
p1033
aVHomer's tribute to baseball salutes the Phillies and their fans! Any town that can boo Mike Schmidt and Santa Claus is okay by me.
p1034
aVI loved "Boardwalk Empire." My favorite character -- the cotton candy machine.
p1035
aVThe Minnesota Vikings are off to a rough start, 0 and 2. Coincidentally, that's also the record of my heart vs pork cholesterol.
p1036
aV...me having sex with Marge with the kids home.
p1037
aVTwo miracles of deception, timing, and guts last Saturday: MSU\u2019s fake field goal against Notre Dame; ...
p1038
aVHomer's tribute to baseball salutes the New York Mets! Just like me, they haven't done anything worth celebrating since 1986.
p1039
aVWoohoo, the new TV season is here! No more having to talk to Marge or the kids till June!
p1040
aVDear Cubs fans, I feel your pain. I, too, have been cursed by a Billy Goat. It kicked me in the crotch as I tried to eat it.
p1041
aVSchool starting makes me think how Bart\u2019s growing up. Pretty soon my little boy will be moving out, off to prison. Sunrise, sunset.
p1042
aVThe NFL should replace the preseason games with a big party where the players say goodbye to their knees and Achilles tendons.
p1043
aVThe Jets have a brand new stadium in New Jersey, with skyboxes, play areas, and over 200 mobsters buried in the foundations.
p1044
aVIt\u2019s Yom Kippur, when Jews don\u2019t eat all day. Woo-hoo, more bacon for me!
p1045
aVBart became Jewish to miss school on their holidays. He plans to switch back after Hannukah but before Xmas to get double presents.
p1046
aVGoing to a Parent/Teacher meeting, which, for me to get through it, means a Homer/6-pack meeting.
p1047
aVJust got some Back To School supplies for the kids, now some for me and Marge: a big bag of Cheetos and a bottle of champagne.
p1048
aVIt\u2019s \u201cBack To School\u201d time, which for me, means \u201cBack To Walking Around The House With No Pants On.\u201d
p1049
aVIt\u2019s National Grandparents day but I don\u2019t celebrate it \u2018cause I never bought Grandpa a computer. Or TV. Or calendar. Or medicine.
p1050
aVYou don\u2019t have to spend a lot to have a backyard pool party. Just drive your backhoe through the waterline in Flanders\u2019s backyard.
p1051
aVJewish people have it great. They get New Year\u2019s early and don\u2019t have to see Ryan Seacrest all over their TV.
p1052
aVTwo great end-of-summer traditions: backyard barbeques and me crashing them.
p1053
aVLabor Day is over, and all I have to remember it by is the incredibly painful sunburn on my bald spot.
p1054
aVI don\u2019t know why we celebrate Labor Day. Marge has spent a lot of time in labor and all I got was three rotten kids.
p1055
aVAt the beach today, a great white shark thought I was a seal and tried to eat me, but I\u2019m okay. It wasn\u2019t used to that much blubber
p1056
aVHooray for Labor Day, the day we celebrate America\u2019s workers by getting them drunk and sunburned.
p1057
aVWoo hoo, no work Monday! (Even though I\u2019ve always considered that day optional.)
p1058
aVI'm at work. If anyone here is reading this, that chocolate donut is mine. No not that one. The other one.
p1059
aVFlowers I like: Brandon. Flowers I hate: the grow-y ones.
p1060
aV...An option I decline, thank you.
p1061
aVWinter is great because the weather keeps your beer cold, but you can\u2019t beat summer because pants are optional...
p1062
aVFun summer activity: trim your hedges so they read \u201cYou suck, Flanders.\u201d
p1063
aVWho needs expensive air conditioning when you\u2019ve trained two kids to stand for hours fanning you with a magazine.
p1064
aV...Ironic isn't it it? They had to be out of school to actually learn something they can use!
p1065
aVWith no school, the kids can bring beers right to my hammock...
p1066
aVI love the summer sports... tennis, golf, lawn bowling. And by love I mean love lying on the sofa watching them on TV.
p1067
aVI wish summer was in the winter. That way the kids would be in school and I could really enjoy myself.
p1068
aVMan, it\u2019s so hot you could cook a steak on the sidewalk. Okay, maybe it would be rare on the inside, but crusted with sidewalk dirt?... Yum!
p1069
aVIf anyone is going to the beach this weekend, you\u2019ve been warned: a drunk fat guy with rotten kids is probably gonna ruin your day
p1070
aVPerfect summer activity - moon the sun. I think that's called an eclipse.
p1071
aVI love summer - I don't have to drive the kids to school. It's as great as it was when Lisa was sick and Bart was suspended.
p1072
aVNothing cools you down on a hot summer day like filling Maggie\u2019s wading pool with beer, getting in, and drinking.
p1073
aVTime for a classic summer ritual: skinnydipping in the ol\u2019 swimming hole...
p1074
aVIt's so hot today. Now I know how soup feels. But not gazpacho - that's winter.
p1075
aVI'm soaking in a kiddy pool drinking a six-pack. This is the best day at work ever!
p1076
aV...Wait, I think that might have been Lex Luthor.
p1077
aVStupid sun. Why doesn't Obama blow that hot jerk up already? I'm pretty sure it was his campaign promise...
p1078
aVI don't think this is the summer of love. From calendars I've seen, it's the summer of 2010.
p1079
aVOh my God, what did I do? Three weeks in a car with this rotten kid? C'mon, stroke -- take me now!
p1080
aVBart and I are taking a road trip to every Major League ballpark this summer. It's our chance to have some quality father & son time.
p1081
aVI\u2019m going to a family reunion BBQ at the park today. I\u2019ll pick the family when I get there \u2013 probably whoever has the thickest burgers.
p1082
aVBart's even failing summer school. He may have to go to school when the summer ends, too. A vicious cycle.
p1083
aVI\u2019m off on my summer holiday, which is going to work so I can get away from Bart and Lisa.
p1084
aVI\u2019m tired of these dumb billboards that say \u201cWHO IS SALT?\u201d Salt is the best friend a plate of spaghetti and meatballs ever had, that\u2019s who!
p1085
aVSeeing \u201cInception\u201d gave me a great idea: go into Marge's dreams and make her cook me pork chops every night.
p1086
aV...But now I have to wait to go home - I've been drinking and I can't drive.
p1087
aVIt's so hot here today, I only came to work because it's air-conditioned...
p1088
aVNo, it wasn\u2019t Corey Pavin, it was Jeremy Piven. These celebrity golf tournaments are confusing.
p1089
aVJust saw Corey Pavin.
p1090
aVPlaying a game at the beach with Bart. He buried me in sand but instead of "Homer," he keeps calling me "imu"...
p1091
aV...Stupid kid. Even his hawaiian friends were laughing.
p1092
aVThe 7/31 baseball trading deadline is near. I'm considering sending Bart to the Flanders family for a socket wrench & beer to be named later
p1093
aVChomp, chomp, chomp... hey, wait a minute. If I\u2019m trying to eat my cell phone, what did I just tweet on my pork chop?
p1094
aVYou know how sometimes a phone number can spell stuff? Mine just spells a bunch of numbers.
p1095
aVThere's nothing good on TV and I'm sober - why do I even come in to work at all?
p1096
aVI\u2019m so proud of Maggie. She just learned two new ways to barf on Daddy.
p1097
aVThis weekend I\u2019m going to see Insane Clown Posse, or, as Marge insists I call it, a NASCAR race.
p1098
aVIt\u2019s funny... We have a ton of photos of Bart, a few photos of Lisa, and none of Maggie. I guess that means Maggie is a vampire.
p1099
aVHere\u2019s a funny joke: \u201cI\u2019d like to buy life insurance.\u201d I don\u2019t get it, but my insurance broker sure laughed when I said it.
p1100
aVI applied for a job in \u201cThe Land that Time Forgot\u201d \u2018cause I figured no one there would notice when I show up late.
p1101
aVJust lost 20 bucks. Thanks Lenny. That's what I get for believing in you.
p1102
aVArguing at Moe's. Would Lenny cry if Moe shot him in leg? I say no.
p1103
aVThat British Open would be way better if they played it in America. Oh well, that's what we get for losing the Civil War.
p1104
aV...That joke's kinda sad but also hilarious, so I regret nothing.
p1105
aVI just realized my dad is like a pro golfer: he putters around and counts how many strokes he has...
p1106
aVThat St. Andrews isn't such a great golf course. I don't see one windmill or plaster dinosaur. How the hell do you win a free game there...
p1107
aVI'm home watching golf on TV but I don't know if I can keep up this fast-paced lifestyle.
p1108
aVBritish Open? We should have a US Open! Oh, we do? Good, finally someone is listening to me.
p1109
aVHey, I\u2019m tweeting from the bathtub. You\u2019ll never guess what floats! Hint: It\u2019s not my cellphone...
p1110
aVFor Bastille Day I\u2019m eating baguettes with Patty and Selma, another couple of real baguettes.
p1111
aVJuly 14 is \u201cBastille Day\u201d, when the French overthrew their king and gained the freedom to be obnoxious as they liked.
p1112
aVToday is the one day all year when there is no professional sports game scheduled of any kind. Or as Marge calls it: Christmas.
p1113
aVInstead of goofing off & helping Danny Glover win the pennant they could\u2019ve been looking out for Hurricane Katrina or something #allstargame
p1114
aVRemember that movie \u201cAngels in the Outfield?\u201d Angels have no business playing baseball! #allstargame
p1115
aVI soak bread in booze and cook it. That way it's 2 kinds of toast at once!
p1116
aVThe World Cup is over for another 4 yrs. That may be enough time to destroy every last soccer ball so I never have to go through this again
p1117
aVI\u2019m not into either team in the World Cup final. One gave us Spanish influenza, and the other gave us the Dutch oven. #worldcup
p1118
aVIt\u2019s Spain vs the Netherlands in the World Cup final and the couch versus my netherlands as I sit and watch it.
p1119
aVOkay, this World Cup soccer... which team is Beckham and which team is Pelé?
p1120
aVThe vuvuzela is the world\u2019s most annoying horn and Bart won\u2019t stop playing it! I\u2019ll kill the international spirit of peace! #worldcup
p1121
aVBart asked for a vuvuzela. I don\u2019t know what that is, but Bart said it supports the World Cup\u2019s international spirit of peace, so I said yes
p1122
aVEveryone\u2019s talking World Cup soccer, but there\u2019s gotta be something wrong with a sport that\u2019s loved by 4 billion foreigners and Lisa.
p1123
aVI took the kids to see \u201cDespicable Me,\u201d but the usher kicked me out for drinking beer in the balcony. More like Despicable HIM
p1124
aVI\u2019m gonna become a bank and ask for Federal bailout money. It\u2019s obvious I\u2019m too fat to fail.
p1125
aVI got mercury poisoning at a sushi restaurant. I bit into their thermostat.
p1126
aVLisa asked why the sky is blue and I told her because it\u2019s the cheapest color. Washington cheapskates!
p1127
aVCute huh? She just hits the keys - she doesn't know it\u2019s not a real word.
p1128
aVSCHISM
p1129
aVSorry everyone, Maggie wants to type something...
p1130
aVTo everyone who watched the fireworks last night: I'm sorry you had to see me and Bart fight over the last hot dog like that.
p1131
aVThe 4th of July means it's time to say hello to summer and goodbye to one or more of my fingers.
p1132
aVIt's Independence Day, when I pay tribute to my Uncle Sam. He and Aunt Lyda gave me my first beer at a picnic when I was nine.
p1133
aVI'm watching #Wimbledon. I haven't seen yellow balls whacked so hard since the last time we had dinner with Marge's sisters.
p1134
aVI\u2019m hoping the mind-bending twist of the new M. Night Shyamalan movie is that it turns out to be good. #lastairbender
p1135
aVI'm thinking about suing this computer company. How can they call this a laptop when I don't have a lap?
p1136
aVThe best web link of all is the one that points to your imagination. But when I click on mine I get \u201cpage not found.\u201d
p1137
aVHappy National Chocolate Pudding Day. 500 million gallons of pudding will be eaten today, all of it by me. Also, I invented this holiday.
p1138
aVI'm drinking out of the toilet. The dog got me into it.
p1139
aVOn a bike ride... saddle caught between butt cheeks... painful... but good exercise.
p1140
aVJune brides are everywhere! Plus one June gargoyle: Marge\u2019s sister Selma is getting married again.
p1141
aVIt\u2019s the start of Wimbledon, the tournament the British invented so they\u2019d have one more sport to lose at.
p1142
aVIf all those extra hours of daylight get to you, spend \u2019em like I do - inside Moe\u2019s bar, where sunlight never penetrates.
p1143
aVThere\u2019s one big problem with Father\u2019s Day. The only way to have it is by having kids.
p1144
aVOn Father\u2019s Day, I laze around on the sofa all day while my kids bring me beer and snacks. So just like every other day.
p1145
aVThe miracle of Father\u2019s Day: Last year\u2019s crappy gift from my kids becomes this year\u2019s crappy gift to my dad.
p1146
aVHey, get a load of me. I\u2019m strangling Bart with one hand and tweeting with the other. Digital parenting.
p1147
aV\u201cWhen life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\u201d But who gives you the sugar and the pitcher? Death and undeath?
p1148
aVJune is Adopt-a-Cat month. My special offer: adopt our cat, get one ten-year-old boy for free.
p1149
aVFor Flag Day, I\u2019m honoring Old Glory by getting drunk on domestic beer with a US flag cocktail napkin.
p1150
aVJune is busting out all over! And a rash is breaking out all over my butt. Related?
p1151
aVI bet now all you people who voted against my plan to make Christmas go year round are feeling kind of stupid, huh?
p1152
aVWhy June is good: if you pass out drunk and spend the night on the hammock, frost doesn\u2019t form on you.
p1153
aVWhy June is bad: some idiot sent the kids home from school for summer vacation.
p1154
aVIt\u2019d be funny if your Mom was April, your friend was June and July meant sleepover. \u2018Cause then \u201cApril, may June july?\u201d
p1155
aVI love Summer Movie Season. At last I can escape my humdrum life and the humdrum way I usually escape it: beer.
p1156
aVIt\u2019s the anniversary of D-Day, when so many brave soldiers died protecting our freedom. Sadly, my father was not one of them.
p1157
aVAh, Summer movie season is here: four straight months of picking popcorn shells out of my teeth!
p1158
aVDid you see the news today? If so, don't tell me what happened. I\u2019m taping it.
p1159
aVHow do we know when spring becomes summer? Oh yeah, the calendar.
p1160
aVI know I\u2019m supposed to remember something today, but what?
p1161
aVI love the Indy 500. The checkered flag reminds me of a tablecloth at Luigi\u2019s.
p1162
aVIn honor of the Indy 500 today, I will drive my car 500 miles an hour and only turn left.
p1163
aVWho do soldiers remember on Memorial Day? I bet they just watch baseball. So I do that too to honor them.
p1164
aVEmily Post says it\u2019s okay to wear white after Mem. Day. I\u2019ll tell the cops that when they arrest me for going outside in my underpants.
p1165
aVIn honor of Memorial Day, I\u2019m making Bart play all war video games. You\u2019re welcome soldiers.
p1166
aVBig deal: one oil rig blew up in Gulf of Mexico. If you want real environmental catastrophe, give us in the nuke biz a chance. #oilspill
p1167
aVI\u2019ve been advised by certain people to tell you to ignore that last tweet.
p1168
aVOh no, not more #americanidol. Only an idiot would watch a show that\u2019s been on for more than five years.
p1169
aVHey Kara Dioguardi, forget the young hottie, try an old flabby. Oh, who am I kidding? I\u2019m married. I do not hook up. #americanidol
p1170
aVIt\u2019s the finale of #americanidol tonight, where we find out the identity of the luckiest person in America: Simon Cowell.
p1171
aVThe Lost finale was pretty good, but it was no \u201cHomeboys In Outer Space.\u201d
p1172
aVThat was it? That\u2019s the big secret? Castaways were in an Italian restaurant the whole time?! Oh, wait, that was an Olive Garden ad. #lost
p1173
aVCan\u2019t wait for the finale of Lost! First, can anyone fill me in on what the show is about and what happened in all the other episodes?
p1174
aVIt\u2019s only May, but I\u2019m already sneaking into my neighbors\u2019 swimming pools at a mid-July level.
p1175
aVIf April showers bring May flowers, what do May flowers bring? Pilgrims. Lisa assures me that is hilarious but I don\u2019t get it.
p1176
aVI hate May. It thinks it\u2019s so cool because it doesn\u2019t get abbreviated. I can\u2019t wait until Jun.
p1177
aVIt\u2019s time for the TV season finales! I can\u2019t sleep nights wondering how The Marriage Ref is going to end.
p1178
aVMy kids wanted to see Furry Vengeance. So I showed them the inside of my nose and ears.
p1179
aVI think Ron Artest is losing his game. He hasn\u2019t punched one fan yet.  I bet I could get him out of that slump
p1180
aVWait a sec, there\u2019s no lakes in Los Angeles. Or jazz in Utah.  Lucky thing there\u2019s magic in Orlando, or I\u2019d be suspicious.
p1181
aVDo you ever think about which president would have been the best hockey referee? I don\u2019t.
p1182
aVI wish Springfield had an NHL team. Hockey is the only pro sport where I haven\u2019t been thrown out of a stadium for being drunk.
p1183
aVInternational Nurses Day today. I want to say thanks for pumping my stomach so often and sorry about your shoes
p1184
aVI\u2019m all for Wall Street reform. The first one was too long and the new one has Shia LeBeouf in it. Something must be done!
p1185
aVI love hockey. There\u2019s ice and fighting. Just like Moe\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t have ice.
p1186
aVI hope a Canadian team wins the Stanley Cup - what else do those poor people have? Same reason I\u2019m rooting for the Cavs.
p1187
aVCheers to Paul Stanley. Not only was he a great member if KISS, but he gave hockey their cup too!
p1188
aVIn Detroit hockey tradition, I threw an octopus. The cops said no one does that at movies in Springfield. Hockey is confusing.
p1189
aVMother's Day's a scam. How come there's no Father's Day? I plan to write a letter to the President on June 21st.
p1190
aVTake it from me, a tweet isn\u2019t a good Mother\u2019s Day gift. It\u2019s hard to wrap and also it\u2019s not the apron Marge wanted .
p1191
aVHappy to see 88 year-old Betty White host SNL, since she was bumped from it when she was a teen.
p1192
aVTurns out I wasn\u2019t in the Iron Man line after all. Well, at least now I know how to train a dragon.
p1193
aVThe box office is open! Iron Man here I come!
p1194
aVThey\u2019re handing out wristbands! Oh, it\u2019s just some stupid Stop Cancer thing.
p1195
aVI\u2019m back from the bathroom. Did I miss anything?
p1196
aVI have to sneak out of the line for a bathroom break, can anyone hold my place?
p1197
aVHey, some guy in line is dressed just like Iron Man! Wait, that\u2019s a soda machine.
p1198
aVI\u2019m so glad Robert Downey, Jr. got sober. If he did Iron Man on drugs he\u2019d be so confused.
p1199
aVI\u2019m in a huge line to see Iron Man. Sitting on the sidewalk for four hours\u2013my butt is the REAL Iron Man. & Tony Stark. Sorry: Spoiler Alert.
p1200
aVI\u2019ve never missed a slam dunk except once when the donut was bigger than the mug of hot chocolate. #nba
p1201
aVI love mayo so much, I\u2019d even eat it on the cuarto or seis.
p1202
aVI love mayo but unless \u201ccinco\u201d means some sort of food, I\u2019ll just eat mine right from the jar, thank you.
p1203
aV@AmericanIdol is down to five contestants now.  In a surprise move, I\u2019m voting for the fat, bald guy.
p1204
aVThe May TV sweeps are here and that means my months of waiting to find out what common household items can kill me are over!
p1205
aVI find this Larry King scandal shocking. I thought he died years ago.
p1206
aVWe went to see \u201cKick Ass\u201d but it was sold out, so our \u201cBack-up Plan\u201d was to go home and see nothing.
p1207
aVThat oil spill in the Gulf is terrible. Should\u2019ve used nuclear power, where the only leaks are invisible and therefore can\u2019t hurt you.
p1208
aVIt\u2019s Kentucky Derby day!  The winning horse gets to be on TV, the loser on the menu at Krustyburger.
p1209
aVHorse races - all talk & two minutes of action, just like a honeymoon. Right, fellas? (I may need to sleep on your couch.)
p1210
aVe.e. cummings wrote that Spring is when the world is \u201cmud-luscious\u201d and \u201cpuddle-wonderful.\u201d I wish I had what he was drinking.
p1211
aVIf you can read this, I need help. I've forgotten how to log on to Twitter.
p1212
aVI forgive Mark McGwire. As a beer drinker, it\u2019d be wrong of me to judge a man for putting something into his body that made him awesome.
p1213
aVI\u2019ll never get over my mom tossing out all my baseball cards as a kid. They were valuable, unlike Bart\u2019s cards that I threw out today.
p1214
aVThey say the days are starting to get longer. That goes double for when my wife\u2019s sisters come over.
p1215
aVThey say April showers bring May flowers but I wouldn\u2019t know, since I haven\u2019t showered in three years.
p1216
aVAh, Spring, when flowers bloom, young mens\u2019 thoughts turn to love, and I stop shoveling my snow into Flanders driveway.
p1217
aVWell, The Masters is over and I can\u2019t believe I wasted 4 days watching guys hit balls with sticks. I could\u2019ve been watching baseball!
p1218
aVI was at the Masters once but they chased me off because everywhere I stepped I added new holes to the greens. I\u2019m fat alright.
p1219
aVMy Masters \u201cAmen Corner\u201d is where I try to fit my belt around my belly. A lot of belt\u2019s dreams have died there.
p1220
aVI feel sorry for the guys at the Masters with sand wedges. I\u2018ve been to the beach and gotten sand wedged up in there too.
p1221
aVThe Masters: the jackets are green, the course is green, and everyone else is white, white, white.
p1222
aVUgh, they call the Masters \u201cgolf\u201d? Where\u2019s the windmills and castles?
p1223
aVProfessional golf: America\u2019s biggest snoozefest except for any speech by Joe Biden.
p1224
aVThey should make the Masters more challenging by shooting at the golfers with a pizza cannon. Then they should send me that cannon.
p1225
aVIf anyone at the Masters needs a caddy who can\u2019t carry clubs more than fifty feet but who WILL bring schnapps shooters, call me.
p1226
aVGood thing Tiger\u2019s not skipping the Masters since they couldn\u2019t replace him with one of the many, many other black golfers on the Tour.
p1227
aVHomer\u2019s fearless pennant race prediction: A team full of rich guys will win it all! And another team full of rich guys is going to lose!
p1228
aVThey used to say rooting for the Yankees is like rooting for U.S. Steel.  Now, rooting for U.S. Steel is like rooting for the Royals.
p1229
aVI say they earn every cent.  Name me one teacher who\u2019s had to listen to Chris Berman yammer on.
p1230

p1234

p1235

p1237
aVHey, everyone: if you\u2019re not a Christian, don\u2019t celebrate Easter. More stuff for me.

aVHey, it\u2019s the \u201cEaster Parade\u201d... of chocolate eggs headed into my mouth.

p1241
aVThis machine will explode in 5\u20264\u20263...2...1\u2026 April Fools! Unless it really did blow up, then you\u2019re welcome for the warning.
p1242

aVI love Spring Training! It\u2019s the one time of the year that professional athletes are as fat and out of shape as I am.
p1254
aVMy \u201cSweet Sixteen\u201d is a dozen doughnuts on the way to work plus the four I steal from Lenny and Carl.

aVAh, it\u2019s Spring. Where the air is filled with the smell of fresh flowers, newly-cut grass, and urine spiked with human growth hormone.

p1257
aVIt\u2019s Spring, when a young man\u2019s fancy turns to thoughts of love. And a fat man\u2019s fancy turns to thoughts of barbecue.

aVMarch 15 is my favorite holiday: The Ides of March Day. The spooky day of omens, foretelling, and imperial Roman assassinations!

p1273
aVWhat's wrong fellas? Seems like I'm the only one out here celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day. What happened to romance?

p1298

aVIt\u2019s Oscar\u2019s night to shine!  And Grammy\u2019s night to drunk-dial some old boyfriends.

aVBoy, these ski patrol guys are sure nice.  It was almost worth breaking my leg to meet them.   #olympics

aVOnly two months until baseball Opening Day. And only 2 years, 10 months, and 16 days until the world is destroyed by the Mayan calendar.
p1322
aVNo, it\u2019s fine.  I just forgot the entire year between last Groundhog Day and today.
p1323
aVIt\u2019s Groundhog Day again?!  But it was Groundhog Day yesterday.  Oh my God, I\u2019m repeating the same day over and over!
p1324
aVBuddy Holly & Lynyrd Skynyrd never won a Grammy, but Weird Al has three. The lesson? Good things come to those who fly commercial. #grammys
p1325
aVWait, they have Latin #Grammys?  What's next, the Sanskrit Oscars?   Lisa wrote that one -- she says you'll get it.
p1326
aVI like the "Death Package" reel at the #Grammys.  As a Grammy winner, I can't wait till the year I'm in it.   That'll be fun to watch!

aVHey, Grammy Awards!  Your statue is out of date.   A gramophone?  Uh, there\u2019s this thing now called 8 tracks \u2013 maybe you\u2019ve heard of it.
p1331
aVIf anything, we should have exactly the same amount of #Grammys: 35.
p1332
aVYou know the Grammy Awards are messed up when you realize that I have more #Grammys than The Beatles.
p1333
aVAs a Grammy winner myself, my advice to this year\u2019s winners is, don\u2019t use the award to eat chili out of.
p1334
aVQuick question: if your car hits ice and you're spinning off the bridge, do you turn into the skid? I need to know fast.
p1335

p1347
aVI wonder what Dick Cheney will think of Obama's speech tonight.  We'll find out when Cheney runs on up and does a Kanye on him.
p1348
aVI have a great State Of The Union Speech drinking game.  I chug beer whenever the President says anything.
p1349
aVThe union we\u2019re talking about is the Major League Baseball Players Association, right?
p1350
aVI don\u2019t need to hear some speech to know what the state of the union is.  It rocks!
p1351
aVI say Glenn Beck will cry, but he's gonna do it to distract people from noticing he just pooped his pants.
p1352
aVLenny says Glenn Beck will cry within five minutes of the speech ending.
p1353
aVLenny and I have a bet about the State of The Union speech.
p1354

p1355
aVIf you're at the bottom of this toboggan hill, fair warning: fat man coming down out of control.
p1356

p1357
aVWhat if we\u2019re living inside some giant alien\u2019s snowglobe?  But the alien\u2019s really hot, like Angelina Jolie.  That would be okay.
p1358
aVYou know how it's fun to catch snow flakes on your tongue?  Don't do that with giant icicles.
p1359
aVNow it\u2019s too hot and too cold.  But I\u2019m too tired to move.  Marge!
p1360
aVNow it\u2019s too hot.  I\u2019m pouring ice cubes down my back.

p1363
aVIt\u2019s so cold, I\u2019m turning up the heat.
p1364
aVHere's a question:  if you borrow a snowblower but break it by running over a rock,  how deep should you bury it so Flanders can't find it?
p1365
aVThis winter I plan to hibernate.  I've stored a ton of fat, I can sleep for months at time,  and I've built a den under the sofa.
p1366

p1367
aVThis is a great time of year for the sports fan \u2013 smack dab in the middle of the NBA season!
p1368

p1370
aVMaybe one day, one of them will even refuse me as a customer for my poor credit!
p1371
aVI love watching football and imagining all the car dealerships the players are going to open when they retire.
p1372
aVI hope a pro football team goes 16 and 0 this year.   Especially if it\u2019s one of the teams that have already lost a bunch of games.
p1373
aVGot the credit card bills from Christmas.  I just had my first coronary event of the new year!
p1374

p1384
aVIf you had as much fun as I did on New Years Eve, I bet you\u2019re also still in bed with ten pillows over your head.
p1385
aVWoo hoo, it's New Years Eve -- or as I call it, "Get Drunk and Embarrass Your Wife Eve".
p1386
aVPractice New Years Eve countdown: "Ten, nine, eight, four, seven, nine, whatever..."  What?  That's how I count when I'm wasted.
p1387
aVIt's almost time for New Year's Rockin' Eve, where I begin the new year by watching the music acts and feeling incredibly old and depressed.
p1388
aVEveryone talks about the quarterback at Notre Dame, but never the hunchback. That\u2019s a joke I made up. Try telling it and I\u2019ll sue you.
p1389
aVThere\u2019s so many different college bowl  games, it\u2019s hard to know which team I don\u2019t know anything about to root for.
p1390
aVSeems like if their opponents figure that out, there goes the element of surprise about who\u2019s playing quarterback.
p1391
aVYou know how college quarterbacks have the most helmet stickers?
p1392
aVBowl game I\u2019d like to see: tapioca versus pudding.

p1398
aV'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, you could hear me yelling as I tried to assemble Bart's stupid new dirt bike.
p1399
aVI love playing videogames with Bart - it still counts as time spent together but I don't have to talk to him.  Now that's parenting!
p1400
aVWhat\u2019s gone wrong with this country?
p1401
aVI found a baby abandoned outside the other day.  But when I took it to the police they arrested me for vandalizing a nativity scene.
p1402
aVI learned a great lesson today. If you let Christmas carolers into your house, double check that they didn\u2019t drive there in a \u201cREPO\u201d van.
p1403
aVI get the next few days off for Christmas.  It\u2019s not as much fun having time off when you\u2019re not even supposed to be at work.
p1404
aVKind of selfish of him if you ask me.
p1405
aVWe were all looking forward to calling him \u201cRudolph\u201d at Christmas-time, but then he went sober and stopped coming in.
p1406
aVThere\u2019s a horrible alcoholic at Moe\u2019s who has a bright red nose.
p1407
aVOn Christmas, we love to watch that show where that big log just burns all night -- otherwise known as "The Glenn Beck Program."
p1408
aVI\u2019m turning him in to the FBI - right after he brings me my massage chair.
p1409
aVThis Santa Claus guy also goes by \u201cKris Kringle\u201d and has no known address.  Sounds suspicious.
p1410
aVAnybody need some myrrh?  I\u2019m regifting.  Keeping the frankincense, though.  That stuff rocks.
p1411
aVSo I got a job as a department store Santa and now I can enjoy my time at home, knowing I\u2019m not showing up for that.
p1412
aVIf this goes well, maybe I\u2019ll write a song about love \u2013 another unexplored area.
p1413
aVI got a great idea.  I\u2019m gonna write a song about Christmas.  It\u2019ll be huge and no one\u2019s ever done it before.
p1414
aVSleigh bells ring, are you listening?  No I'm not, that's why I hit your dumb sleigh with my car.

p1422
aVI'm hanging upside down off the roof in a tangle of holiday lights.  Could someone tell Marge?  But do not tell Bart.
p1423
aVI hate how on Chanukah people make potato pancakes.  Those pancakes could be used for vodka or even potato beer!
p1424
aVCongrats to "Precious" on its Golden Globe nomination!  I haven't seen it yet, but is it just about Gollum, or is Frodo in it too?
p1425
aVI'll be there because I plan on passing out on the TV room floor the night before.
p1426
aVI don't know about you, but I'm gonna be in front of my TV at dawn for the Golden Globe nominations.
p1427
aVDoes anyone know where I can buy a Kwanzaa bush?  Otherwise it's coming out of Flanders' front yard.
p1428
aVWe used Barney as a dreidel for a while, spinning him around and betting on how he\u2019d land.  We stopped when he threw up on all our shoes.

aVWhy can\u2019t it be: if you stand under mistletoe, someone has to give you a hamburger?
p1430
aVJust heard a song called \u201cI Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\u201d.  I'm outraged.  Santa comes near Marge, he's a fat jolly dead elf.
