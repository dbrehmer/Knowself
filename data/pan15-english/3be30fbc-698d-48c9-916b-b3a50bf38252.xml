	<document><![CDATA[@username Doesn't matter much. Plenty of them support it. Current 'alpha males' didn't start patriarchy either.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username It's not about the money. It's about promising 1 video a month and only delivering 4 vids in 2 years.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[No, PC Advisor. Inkjet printers do NOT fall under the category of color laser printers... http://t.co/qt1Apjcd76		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[And no, @username. Anything that has a sticker saying "Xerox" is not an HP Officejet. Nor is the 8100 a laser printer. http://t.co/cYSFi4GEns		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers.		]]></document>

	<document><![CDATA[I really quite like it that Red Bull will just up and fund stuff like Danny MacAskill's Imaginate: http://t.co/Njw81iVzjy via @username		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing. The prominence and promotion of those games is.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[It sucks when your phone suddenly won't read a simcard any more. It sucks even more when your PC breaks while looking for a solution. =(		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hurray for Dutch sportsball, huh?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I was on @username and noticed all the 3d models work just fine on my Nexus 7. *thumbs up* for crossplatform functionality!		]]></document>

	<document><![CDATA[@username Man, what a waste of a tweet, talking about responses you don't like... You could have spent it on making a "WTF is?" video ;)		]]></document>

	<document><![CDATA[Bought a new PC with Windows 8.1 hoping it wouldn't be so bad now with the updates. After a day I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown... =(		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Seriously. Who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app? I don't need 1920x1200 to multiply some numbers.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Instead you want these. Chocolate/marzipan/sugarsprinkles. Don't know the English name. http://t.co/znQjgxeIav		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Yeah I've been looking into similar things, like the stuff from @username. Not sure what I end up choosing yet.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Also, W8.1 apparently has regular calc, but also an appified version (as default) for added confusion and frustration.*sigh*		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Definitely gonna give it a try. Seems to be the most feature rich one, and I love the price of free.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Right now? I don't really know. There's no way to disable the metro bit (outside of 3rd party (cont) http://t.co/7zMcs94hQM		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Pix or it didn't happen. (Or linx)		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Maybe they're taking the adage "all publicity is good publicity" a tad too literal?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Heh. I like how they call Forbes 'unprofessional'. It's only a century old business magazine, after all.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Well, #Dota2TI4 championship final was a bit of a letdown... Very one-sided, almost like the Brazil  #FIFA2014 matches earlier this month.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username How come NL/EU prices for businesses are so skewed? I almost understand $140 -> €140 But there's no way $400 should -> €540($727)		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Statistics! Colors! Games! Graphs! Numbers! Info! Money! Jerbs! Exclamation Marks! http://t.co/hveVXSCr9V #gamedev		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Ooh. Freddie Mercury! I loved his music in Neverending Story as well. But why is that Spiderman quote in there?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Your bundle currently costs. ?€ I thought that was funny.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Remember when you mentioned RU-UA-EU war? It's already happening on kickstarter, according to Areal! http://t.co/Tqbsyc9eSC		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[This is a good looking kickstarter! https://t.co/9EmXuUuNd2 Love the vid and the header gifs. (oh and the game itself looks interesting too)		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[I wouldn't hurt the proverbial fly, but those damn mosquitos... Just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username With you being you, I'm not sure if that's ASAP or never.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[How come art software always has such a shitty GUI? I'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Will this work with the regular PC forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? Would be handy to have that integrated.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. A downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Can hardly wait for PC version X. What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username It really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate. Often I find they add too much powder, too.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[I... Uh... what? Dafuq?
https://t.co/VT0eMJofYN		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Don't worry. You will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. http://t.co/c8qaZNjW3L		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username How are the podcasts rubbish? Only thing edited for (the YT version of) that are the commercials, right?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I get the removal of streamed 'regular' music, I do. But background music from games? And beyond that, do you think that (1/2)		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=©, too) You generally say that streaming is a transformative art.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Technically, this is a mobile game. And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders.

https://t.co/Wr1elzCRf4		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username No. You'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Ooh. Sanchez. I strongly approve of this.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators. (semi)Finals get more views.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Says it right there "? The Jester Race
A song by In Flames"		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Given that you regularly do long takes, though, this one felt "slighly off". (j/k well done Zooc)		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game, just not a GOOD one.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope, nope, nope, this looks decent.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box...		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username AND DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YO. (also my shirt)		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username http://t.co/LrtfFdiNqJ seems kind of relevant in this case too. From several perspectives.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username You're right on the first account. Many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of  debates is divisive. http://t.co/E4kkt588dH		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username What's the crest for that?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username That actually seems interesting data, yeah. I wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. Sorry mr snail...		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Liking youtubers isn't a problem either. Which leaves "harassing" as the only issue.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Threat? Or... treat?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. Good on you, Germany. http://t.co/W62Wy4yIyr		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I know, right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username For me, personally, it's like a TV show. I can relax to it because it's more passive than articles, yet is not supershort.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.Wonder where this will go?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username You mean "asshole" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Jim, try Monster Rehab. It's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... I mean sweeteners.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay €35 AND €70. Personally, I just wait for price drops.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says "at your own risk". It might work fine, it might cost you.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Ooh, this is pretty. Any info on how it's done? Looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username What, you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? Is this some kind of magic? Are you a wizerds?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username It is rather uncanny... http://t.co/EzJMUWrtS0		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Just binge-read the entirety of @username's comic. It's gooood. http://t.co/jVOCCOc5fp		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username With 300+ employees, they're well past the 'Dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Didn't know I, a European, could send emails about net neutrality to US Gov. EUROPEANS UNITE! http://t.co/iJssKlF3rJ http://t.co/11MWt6BLo7		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I've always likened Dear Esther to a book or movie. You can press play/pause, but you don't really have any agency.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Personally, I'd love physical media as an option, if it were JUST that. But most games nowadays are just a DVD + steam code.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Next bundle? http://t.co/OJ7iOFedwb		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username you have your own NPC and you're giving out games? CONSPIRACYYY!!!!		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username He's an author at Destructoid. He IS games media.

Conrad, thanks for making the distinction.		]]></document>
