# Knowself
## What can be learned about personality from writing samples.
As determined from the Twitter stream, Facebook posts and stream-of-consciousness
essays.

## The Datasets:
Three sets of data were found of writing with personality labels.
  1. Twitter posts from 152 unique people, 14166 in total.
  2. Facebook posts from 250 unique people, 9917 in total.
  3. Stream of consciousness essays from 2468 unique people.

## The Application:
The plan is to use the model to predict personality given a person'd twitter stream.
Given this is the goal the model will probably best be developed using the first dataset,
but there is some interest to know how well a model will do if it is trained on the
other sets, then applied to tweets. Once the tags, user mentions and links are filtered
out the remaining text from twitter may be similar to the stream of consciousness
essays or similarly filtered Facebook posts.

The application will also include a short personality test to gather additional data.
